Question 1 
 
(a) The application EP-F3 to be transferred has to be pending at the time of transfer 
(see steps under (b)).  
File a request for a transfer of rights (EPO Form 5050 can be used) and submit 
written evidence suitable for proving the transfer (with the signature of both the 
assignor and assignee). Pay the transfer fee.  
 
(b) The filing in Italian is valid only if the previous applications were also filed in Italian. 
Request further processing by paying the fee for further processing (50% of the 
relevant fees) by 14 December 2022 and pay the search fee, filing fee (without 
reduction) according to Rule 6(4) EPC including page fee (for eight pages) and 
additional fee for divisional second generation. 
 
(c) After the transfer of rights (at the latest by the time of payment of the reduced 
examination fee) the representative of the joint applicants should send a letter to the 
EPO stating that both applicants A and C are entities or natural persons covered by 
Rule 6(4) EPC (Form 1011 can be used).  
Request examination in Italian, a translation of the request for examination in the 
language of the proceedings must be refiled (Guidelines A-X, 9.2.3).

Question 2 
 
(a) The request for restoration had to be filed within two months of the date on which 
the priority period expired, which is 26 July 2021. 
(The priority period expired on 22 May 2021 extended to 24 May 2021.  
24 May 2021 + 2 months => 24 July 2021, extended to 26 July 2021). 
 
(b) (The restoration granted by the USPTO as receiving Office will not automatically be 
effective before the EPO because the EPO is not bound by the decision of any 
receiving Office under the "unintentional criterion".)  
To ensure that priority is restored during the European phase, the applicant should 
request restoration of priority within one month of the date on which the time limit for 
entry into EPO regional phase expires (Article 22 PCT) 
(Rule 49ter.2(b)(i) PCT; Rule 159(1)) EPC sets a 31-month deadline) 
22.05.2020 + 31 months = 22.12.2022  
22.12.2022 + 1 month = 22.01.2023 (Sunday) extended to 23.01.2023 
(Monday).  
 

The fee for restoration of priority must be paid within the same time limit 
(Rule 49ter.2(b)(iii), (d) PCT).  
The request for restoration of priority must be accompanied by a statement of reasons 
for the failure, despite meeting the due-care requirement, to file the international 
application within the priority period (Rule 49ter.2(b)(ii) PCT). 
____________________________________________________________ 

Question 3 
 
(a) Confirm to the receiving Office (International Bureau) that the drawings of the 
priority application are included in the international patent application through 
incorporation by reference (Rule 20(6) PCT). 
Send a copy of these drawings to the receiving Office (International Bureau) 
together with the confirmation.  
Within two months of the original filing date  
5 December 2022 + 2 months => 5 February 2023 (Sunday) => extended to 
6 February. 
 
(b) Same as (a) / (Confirm to the International Bureau that the drawings of the priority 
application are included in the international patent application through incorporation 
by reference, send a copy of these drawings to the International Bureau together 
with the confirmation).  
 
RO/107 notification bears a two-month time limit, 
4 January 2023 + 2 months => 4 March 2023 (Saturday) => extended to 6 March 
2023 
 
(c) The requirement for incorporation by reference is that the priority of the earlier 
application must also have been claimed on filing (Rule 20(6) PCT). 
Thus, no remedy is possible in this case. 
 
(d) Yes, you can withdraw the application and prevent publication before completion of 
technical preparations for the publication. 
Publication is due promptly after the expiration of 18 months from the priority date, 
which is after 20 June 2023 (in practice Thursday, 22 June). 
The technical preparations for publication are completed by the 15th day prior to the 
date of publication (see paragraph AG 9.014; in practice, withdrawal at the latest on 
Tuesday, 6 June). 
____________________________________________________________ 

Question 4 
 
(a) The filing fee and the search fee shall be paid within one month of filing, i.e. by 
12 January 2023, (Article 78(2) EPC and Rule 38(1) EPC). 

The filing fee includes the additional fee for two pages (36 pages plus one page of 
abstract (even if abstract is two pages) minus 35 pages = 2 pages, Rule 38(2), (3) 
EPC, Article 2(1), item 1a, RFees and Guidelines A-III, 13.2). 
 
(b) The payment is deemed to have been made on the date on which the account was 
duly replenished (point 8 AAD).  
Since this is after the due date for paying the fees, the application is deemed to be 
withdrawn (Article 78(2) EPC). 
No action is required as long as there are sufficient funds in the deposit account 
(the EPO will automatically debit the further processing fee, the search fee and the 
filing fee (which includes the page fee)).  
 
(c) A translation must be filed within two months of the filing of the application 
12 Dec 2022 + 2 months = 12 Feb 2023 (Sun) = 13 Feb 2023; 
or within two months of notification of a communication under Rule 58 EPC.  
 
If documents to be filed by one of the means of electronic communication permitted 
by the President of the European Patent Office (under Rule 2(1) EPC) cannot be 
received on the day on which a period for performing procedural acts expires, the 
period shall extend to the first working day on which all means of electronic filing are 
available (Rule 134(1) EPC and OJ EPO 2020, A120). 
____________________________________________________________ 

Question 5 
 
A divisional application can only be filed if the parent application is still pending. 
Currently, EP-A1 is deemed to be withdrawn because no response to the 
communication under Article 94(3) EPC was filed. The time limit for filing a response 
expired on 28 November 2022 (26 Saturday > Monday 28). 
In order to revert application EP-A1 to pending status, the applicant must request 
further processing by paying the further processing fee and file a response to the 
communication under Article 94(3) EPC. 
 
The filing fee and search fee for EP-A2 are due on filing. They may be paid within one 
month of the date of filing of the divisional application (Rule 36(3) EPC). 
The third renewal fee and the fourth renewal fee for the divisional become due on filing. 
They can be validly paid without surcharge within four months of the date of filing of the 
divisional application (Rule 51(3) EPC) (otherwise with surcharge within six months of 
the same date). 
 
The applicant should file claims directed to invention Y (Rule 40(1) EPC) in response to 
a communication from the EPO (under Rule 58 EPC setting a time limit of two months 
from the date of receipt to supply claims) at the latest.
