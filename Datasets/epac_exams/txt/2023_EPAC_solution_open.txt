(a) X should file a demand (using Form PCT/IPEA/401) (mention of Art 34 accepted) at 

the EPO and specifying the EPO as IPEA. 
 

(b) The time limit for filing the demand is 22 months from priority (11 November 2023 

(Saturday) extended to 13 November 2023 (Monday)) or 3 months from SR (11 
August 2023 (Friday)). 

 

(c) File a reply (with amendments) to the written opinion and pay the fee for preliminary 

examination and the handling fee (to the EPO). 

 
Question 2

162(2) EPC. 

 

(d) Appoint a representative. 

 
Question 3 
 

(a) (Rule 64(1)) has a deadline of 2m from the notification of the communication, 

therefore the 10-day rule still currently applies. 5 September 2023 + 10d = 15 
September 2023 + 2m = 15 November 2023. 
 

(b) No action is required. If no response is filed to the R64(1) communication, the 

published search report will be based on the first mentioned invention (i.e., A1).

2023). A further search report will be issued covering all three inventions. 

 

(d) Request examination for EP-A and file a divisional application for the second 

invention. 


(e) A PPH request based on the US-priority application with the USPTO as OEE cannot 

be filed by using Form 1009 (as the US priority is still under substantive 
examination). EPO Form 1005 can be used to request accelerated examination 
(PACE). 
 

(f) EP-A will be taken out of the PACE programme due to the request for extension of 

time.

(without waiting for a communication from the Examining Division (Gui C-II, 5)) and 
file a PACE request.

within two months from notification of the invitation (Rule 141(3) EPC). 
 
(c) Designation fee: 660 EUR.
