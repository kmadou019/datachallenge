Entry into the national/regional phase is possible at any time after filing the PCT application, but the 30-31 month time limit applies.",
        "Explanation": "The PCT Direct procedure is a service offered by the EPO. Taiwan is not a PCT contracting state, so a national application must be filed.

The Demand can be filed within 22 months from the priority date or 3 months from the receipt of the international search report, whichever is later.
