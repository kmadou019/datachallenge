General

1.1.
Preliminary remarks

In accordance with Rule 3 of the Rules relating to Unitary Patent Protection in conjunction with
Art. 10(2)(a) of the European Patent Convention, the President of the European Patent Office has
adopted, with effect from [date], the Unitary Patent Guidelines.

These Guidelines are updated annually to take account of developments in law and practice related 
to the European patent with unitary effect (referred to as "Unitary Patent"). Usually, updates involve 
amendments to specific sentences or passages on individual pages to bring the text into line with
legal developments regarding the Unitary Patent and EPO practice as these continue to evolve. It 
follows that no update can ever claim to be complete. In general, each edition is updated to reflect 
the situation as of 1 December of the previous year. Any indication from readers drawing attention 
to errors as well as suggestions for improvement are highly appreciated and may be sent by email 
to unitary_patent_division@epo.org.

The binding version of the Unitary Patent Guidelines is published by the EPO in searchable HTML 
format on the EPO website at epo.org.

1.2.
Explanatory notes

1.2.1.
Overview

The main body of these Guidelines comprises the following seven parts:

Part 1: General; deals with the legal framework, territorial scope and role of the EPO.
Part 2: The request for unitary effect; addresses the filing and processing of the request for unitary 
effect.
Part 3: Fees and compensation; focuses on the fees and the request for compensation.
Part 4: Re-establishment of rights; covers the filing and processing of requests for re-establishment 
of rights.
Part 5: Interruption and resumption of proceedings; concerns matters related to interruption and 
resumption of proceedings.
Part 6: Registration of changes of name and address, transfers, licences and other rights; covers 
matters related to the Register for unitary patent protection.
Part 7: Proceedings before the UPP Division; deals with general provisions relevant to the 
proceedings before the UPP Division.

Each part of these Guidelines is divided into sections, which may be further divided into subsections.

Legal framework

These Guidelines provide guidance in respect of the practice in proceedings before the EPO in 
accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012, Council Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012, the UPR
and the RFeesUPP. They address the practice that relates to the procedure for Unitary Patent 
protection. The search and examination practices and procedures relating to European patent
applications, including opposition, revocation and limitation proceedings, are not the subject of the 
Unitary Patent Guidelines. They are dealt with in the EPC Guidelines, which are available on the 
EPO website (epo.org).

The present Guidelines are addressed primarily to the staff of the EPO, but are also intended to 
serve the parties to the proceedings and patent practitioners as a basis for illustrating the law and 
practice in proceedings before the EPO. As a rule, "party to the proceedings" denotes a proprietor 
of a European patent or of a Unitary Patent and, if the party is represented, their representative.

The Guidelines cannot cover all possible occurrences and exceptions in every detail but must be 
regarded as general instructions that may need to be adapted to the individual case. The application 
of the Guidelines to individual European patents and Unitary Patents is the responsibility of the UPP

Division. As a rule, parties may expect the EPO to act in accordance with the Guidelines until such 
time as they – or the relevant legal provisions – are amended or the UPC decides otherwise. Notices 
concerning amendments of legal provisions are published in the Official Journal of the EPO and on 
the EPO website.

The Guidelines do not constitute legal provisions. For the ultimate authority on practice at the EPO, 
it is necessary to refer first to Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012, Council Regulation (EU)
No 1260/2012, the UPR, the RFeesUPP and the UPCA, and second to the interpretation put upon 
the relevant legislation by the UPC. With regard to the applicable EPC provisions, the case law of 
the EPO boards of appeal must also be considered. Where a decision or an opinion of the Enlarged 
Board of Appeal, the Legal Board of Appeal or the UPC is referred to, the practice described has 
been adapted to take account of the said decision or opinion.

Where decisions of the EPO boards of appeal give an interpretation different to what is described in
these Guidelines, EPO staff will follow the practice as described in these Guidelines until further 
notice.

1.3.1.
EU regulations creating enhanced cooperation

The Unitary Patent system is based on Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 (OJ EPO 2013, 111; OJ EU
L 361, 31.12.2012, 1-8), which implements enhanced cooperation for Unitary Patent protection, and 
Council Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012 (OJ EPO 2013, 132; OJ EU L 361, 31.12.2012, 89-92),
which provides for the translation arrangements. Currently, there are 25 EU Member States (all but 
Croatia and Spain) participating in the enhanced cooperation scheme. The EU Member States for 
which the EU regulations are applicable are referred to as "participating Member States" (see 1.5).

The SC was set up by the participating Member States to ensure the governance and supervision of 
the activities related to the tasks they entrusted to the EPO. The SC adopted the UPR (see 1.3.2) 
and RFeesUPP (see 1.3.3), which came into effect with the two regulations on 1 June 2023, upon 
the entry into force of the UPCA.

1.3.2.
Rules relating to Unitary Patent Protection

The UPR lay down the procedures entrusted to the EPO under Regulations (EU) No 1257/2012 and 
No 1260/2012 and provide for the establishment of the UPP Division. The main provisions relate to 
the request for unitary effect, the procedure for obtaining a Unitary Patent at the EPO and the legal 
remedies available. The UPR were adopted in December 2015 and last amended by the Decision 
of the Select Committee of the Administrative Council of 13 November 2024 amending the Rules 
relating to Unitary Patent Protection (SC/D 1/24; see OJ EPO 2024, A96).

1.3.3.
Rules relating to Fees for Unitary Patent Protection

The RFeesUPP set out the fees that must be paid to the EPO as provided for in the UPR, the fees 
and expenses that the President of the EPO lays down and the available methods of payment. The
RFeesUPP also lay down the amount of compensation available for translation costs. The RFeesUPP
were adopted in December 2015 by the SC (OJ EPO 2022, A42) and entered into force on the date 
of entry into force of Regulations (EU) No 1257/2012 and No 1260/2012.

1.3.4.
Relevant EPC provisions and publications in the Official Journal

Certain procedural provisions of the EPC, from the Convention itself and the Implementing 
Regulations, apply mutatis mutandis to procedures under the UPR and the RFeesUPP (Rule 20
UPR, Article 6 RFeesUPP). This serves the purpose of alignment with the existing EPO procedures 
and related practice. Accordingly, decisions of the President of the EPO and notices from the EPO 
concerning the implementation of the EPC provisions cited in the UPR and the RFeesUPP apply 
likewise to Unitary Patent proceedings because they were issued under the relevant EPC provisions, 
which apply mutatis mutandis. Due consideration must also be given to the case law of the EPO 
boards of appeal in relation to the respective EPC provisions.

The President of the EPO has the power to adopt internal administrative instructions and provide 
information to the public to guarantee the implementation of Unitary Patent protection under Rule 3 
UPR and Art. 10(2)(a) EPC. Decisions of the President of the EPO and of the chair of the SC as well 
as notices and information from the EPO are published in the Official Journal. Notices and 
information of a general character issued by the SC or the President of the EPO are also published 
in the Official Journal.

1.4.
The role of the Unified Patent Court

In 2013, 25 EU Member States signed the UPCA, thereby paving the way for the establishment of 
the UPC as a common court with exclusive competence in infringement and revocation disputes 
relating to European patents and Unitary Patents. The UPCA entered into force on 1 June 2023.

Actions against decisions of the UPP Division in carrying out the tasks referred to in Art. 9 Regulation 
(EU) No 1257/2012 may be brought before the UPC. The UPC may invite the EPO to comment. The
EPO will be bound by decisions of the UPC in relation to actions of the UPP Division (Rule 1(1)
UPR).

1.5.
The territorial scope of Unitary Patents

1.5.1.
Territorial scope

The territorial scope of a Unitary Patent covers the territories of those EU Member States 
participating in enhanced cooperation on Unitary Patent protection and in which the UPCA is in force 
at the time of registration of the unitary effect. The scope remains the same for the entire lifetime of 
the Unitary Patent and is not extendable to the participating Member States that ratify the UPCA
after its unitary effect has been registered. The Unitary Patent system became operational on 1 June 
2023 for the following 17 states: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, 
Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia and Sweden.

On 1 September 2024, Romania acceded to the Unitary Patent system, which now covers 18 states 
(see 1.5.2). The territorial scope of each individual Unitary Patent is shown in the Register for unitary 
patent protection (see 7.5.2).

Details on the territorial scope of the Unitary Patent in the participating Member States with overseas 
territories (i.e. Denmark, France, Netherlands) may be found in the EPO publication entitled "National 
measures relating to the Unitary Patent", which is available on the EPO website.

1.5.2.
Additional participating Member States ratifying/accessing the UPCA

A new UP generation is created when the UPC enters into force in a new EU Member State 
participating in enhanced cooperation after the launch of the Unitary Patent system. In practice, this 
means that the territorial scope of Unitary Patents may differ depending on when unitary effect is 
registered. When a new Unitary Patent generation takes effect, the territorial scope of existing 
Unitary Patents will not extend to the territory of the newly acceded participating Member State.

Romania's instrument of ratification of the UPC was deposited on 31 May 2024 and took effect three 
months later. As a result, Romania acceded to the Unitary Patent system on 1 September 2024.
Thus, Unitary Patents registered on or after 1 September 2024 cover 18 states, namely the original 
17 states (see 1.5.1) plus Romania, and constitute the second generation of Unitary Patents.

The EPO allows patent proprietors to request a delay of the registration of unitary effect whenever 
an additional participating Member State has ratified and is due to accede to the UPCA. Such a 
delay can be requested up until the new ratification or accession takes effect. In such cases, the 
territorial scope of the Unitary Patent will then extend to the new participating Member State(s) as 
well. The EPO informs users about such a possibility and the applicable conditions in a dedicated 
notice published in the Official Journal, as in the case of Romania when it was announced that it 
would join the Unitary Patent system on 1 September 2024 (OJ EPO 2024, A61). The filing of a 
request to delay registration does not remove the requirement to meet the one-month time limit for 
requesting unitary effect (see 2.2.1).

1.6.
Role of the UPP Division

The participating Member States have entrusted the EPO with administrative tasks relating, in 
particular, to processing requests for unitary effect, maintaining the Register for unitary patent 
protection and collecting renewal fees (Art. 9 Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 and Rule 4(2) UPR).
The UPP Division was established as a special EPO department with responsibility for dealing with 
these tasks (Rule 4(1) UPR).

Each decision of the UPP Division is taken by a legally qualified member (Rule 4(3) UPR). Certain 
duties have been entrusted to other employees (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 
30 May 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A69).

2.
The request for unitary effect

2.1.
Eligibility (requirements under Rule 5(2) UPR)

To be eligible for unitary effect, a European patent must have been granted with the same set of 
claims in respect of all 25 participating Member States (Rule 5(2)(a) UPR). This condition must be 
met irrespective of the territorial coverage of the Unitary Patent in question. A withdrawal of 
designation for one or more of the participating Member States results in ineligibility for the 
registration of unitary effect (Rule 5(2) UPR, Art. 3(1) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 in conjunction 
with Recital 7 Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 and Rule 138 EPC).

The same applies when claims are missing in respect of one or more of the participating Member 
States. For example, if the date of filing of an application or of the root application in the case of a 
sequence of divisional applications is earlier than 1 March 2007, the resulting European patent will
not have been granted with the same set of claims in respect of all participating Member States as 
required under Rule 5(2)(a) UPR because the last participating Member State within the meaning of 
Art. 2(a) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 and Rule 5(2)(a) UPR to accede to the EPC, i.e. Malta, did 
not do so until 1 March 2007 (OJ EPO 2007, 1).

Furthermore, as far as eligibility is concerned, the proprietor of a European patent should not be 
subject to the restrictive measure laid down in Art. 5s(2) of Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 as 
amended by Regulation (EU) No 2024/1745, having regard to Art. 5s(5) of that amended Regulation
(see new Rule 5(2)(b) UPR, which entered into force on 15 November 2024; see the notice from the 
European Patent Office dated 13 November 2024 concerning the implementation of the 14th 
package of EU sanctions against Russia in procedures related to the Unitary Patent and the 
amendment to the Rules relating to Unitary Patent Protection (OJ EPO 2024, A97)).

2.2.
Requirements

2.2.1.
Form and time limit

The proprietor of a European patent must file a request for unitary effect in writing in the language 
of the proceedings with the EPO (Rule 5(1) UPR). EPO Form 7000 is available for that purpose; its 
use is not mandatory but strongly recommended. The request must be filed no later than one month 
after the publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent in the European Patent 
Bulletin (Art. 9(1)(g) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012; Rule 6(1) UPR; Art. 97(3) EPC). This period is 
a non--extendable. Re-establishment of rights in respect of this period can be requested (see 4.1).

The request for unitary effect may also be filed at an earlier stage, once the decision to grant the 
European patent has been issued (EPO Form 2006A). An early request for unitary effect will however
not be processed by the UPP Division before the date of the publication of the mention of the grant 
of the European patent in the European Patent Bulletin and will only appear in the Register for unitary 
patent protection as of that date. 

Unitary effect must be requested by the proprietor of the European patent (Rule 5(1) UPR). If the 
proprietor changes because a transfer of rights is registered between the filing of an early request 
for unitary effect and the publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent in the 
European Patent Bulletin, the new proprietor will be asked by the UPP Division to confirm the early 
request for unitary effect. If a transfer of rights is pending at the time of filing a request for unitary 
effect, the UPP Division will assess the particularities of the case to determine whether the request 


Unitary Patent Guidelines 
Draft
April 2025

11

for unitary effect may be registered immediately or whether the registration of the transfer of rights
needs first to be confirmed.

2.2.2.
Persons entitled to file a request for unitary effect

A Unitary Patent may be requested for a European patent granted to multiple proprietors in respect 
of the same or different participating Member States on condition that it was granted with the same 
set of claims in respect of all participating Member States. The request must be made by all 
co-proprietors in respect of the participating Member States to which the unitary effect will extend.
However, co-proprietors cannot request unitary effect for a European patent that has been granted 
to them exclusively in respect of one or more EPC contracting states not participating in enhanced 
cooperation or where the UPCA is not in force. Such co-proprietors cannot request unitary effect or 
be designated as common representatives.

Joint proprietors of a European patent filing a request for unitary effect may act through a common 
representative. If the request for unitary effect does not name a common representative, the 
proprietor first named in the request will be considered the common representative. However, if one 
of the proprietors is required to appoint a professional representative under Rule 20(1) UPR in 
conjunction with Art. 133(2) EPC, the duly appointed representative will be considered the common 
representative acting on behalf of all proprietors. In such cases, no other proprietor can act as 
common representative. However, if the proprietor first named in the request has appointed a 
professional representative, that representative will be considered to be acting on behalf of all 
proprietors (Rule 20(2)(l) UPR in conjunction with Rule 151(1) EPC).

The common representative is only entitled to act for all the proprietors if the request for unitary effect 
has been duly signed by all of them or their respective representatives.

2.2.3.
Mandatory information to be provided in the request for unitary effect

The request for unitary effect must contain the following information (Rule 6(2) UPR):

(a)
particulars of the proprietor of the European patent making the request as provided for in 

Rule 41(2)(c) EPC

(b)
the number of the European patent to which unitary effect is to be attributed

(c)
where the requester has appointed a representative, their particulars as provided for in 

Rule 41(2)(d) EPC.

In the case of multiple proprietors, they all need to be listed in the request for unitary effect. However, 
they do not need to be listed in the same order as in the request for grant (EPO Form 1001) or in the 
European patent specification.

The requester(s) must be identical to the proprietor(s) mentioned in the European Patent Register
at the date of filing of the request for unitary effect or, at the latest, at the date of registration of unitary 
effect. A request received under Rule 22 or 85 EPC for a transfer of rights or a request for a change 
of name and/or address after the decision to grant the European patent is issued and the registration 
of the request for unitary effect is pending will be taken into consideration if the transfer or change 
of name and/or address concerns proprietors in respect of the participating Member States to which 
the unitary effect is to extend.

2.2.4.
Language of the request for unitary effect

The request for unitary effect must be filed in the language of the proceedings within the meaning of 
Art. 14(3) EPC (Art. 9(1)(g) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012; Rule 6(2) UPR). This language 
requirement will automatically be satisfied by filing the request for unitary effect with trilingual 
EPO Form 7000 either directly in any of the EPO's online filing tools, by postal services or via the 
EPO Contingency Upload Service.

2.2.5.
Persons entitled to sign the request

A request for unitary effect may be signed by:

−
the proprietor(s) (if residence or principal place of business is in an EPC contracting state)

−
a professional representative (Art. 134(1) EPC)

−
a legal practitioner (Art. 134(8) EPC)

−
a duly authorised employee (Art. 133(3), first sentence, EPC)

If the proprietor is a legal person and the request is not signed by a professional representative or a 
legal practitioner entitled to act as such under Art. 134(1) or (8) EPC, it must be signed: (a) either by 
a person entitled to sign by law, by the proprietor's articles of association or equivalent or by a special 
mandate, with an indication of that person's position within the legal entity, e.g. Geschäftsführer, 
Prokurist, Handlungsbevollmächtigter; chairperson, director, company secretary; directeur, fondé de 
pouvoir (Art. 133(1) EPC), in which case no authorisation need be filed; (b) or, if the legal person's 
principal place of business is in a contracting state, by another employee under Art. 133(3), first 
sentence, EPC (Rule 152(1) to (3) EPC), in which case an authorisation must be filed.

2.2.6.
Voluntary indication of a place of business of the original applicant on the date of 
filing of the European patent application

In addition to the mandatory information under Rule 6(2) UPR, a voluntary indication may be made 
together with the request for unitary effect as to a place of business of the original applicant on the 
date of filing of the European patent application within the meaning of Art. 7(1)(b) Regulation (EU) 
No 1257/2012 (Rule 16(1)(w) UPR).

As an object of property, a Unitary Patent will be treated in its entirety and in all the participating 
Member States as a national patent of the participating Member State in which that patent has unitary 
effect and in which, according to the European Patent Register (Art. 7(1) Regulation (EU) 
No 1257/2012):

(a)
the applicant had their residence or principal place of business on the date of filing of the 

application for the European patent or

(b)
where point (a) does not apply, the applicant had a place of business on the date of filing of 

the application for the European patent.

Where two or more persons are entered in the European Patent Register as joint applicants, see
Art. 7(2) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012.

In cases where an applicant did not have a residence or principal place of business in one of the 
participating Member States within the meaning of point (a) when filing the European patent 
application or the international application under the PCT designating or electing the EPO (Euro-PCT 
application), it can prove useful to have an entry in the Register for unitary patent protection showing 
"a place of business on the date of filing" within the meaning of point (b) (Rule 16(1)(w) UPR).

While indicating a "place of business on the date of filing" is voluntary, that information may only be 
provided together with the request for unitary effect. If, in such circumstances as those mentioned in 
the paragraph above, it is not provided with the request for unitary effect, German law will apply with 
regard to the treatment of the Unitary Patent as an object of property pursuant to Art. 7(3) Regulation 
(EU) No 1257/2012.

Care must be taken to provide the correct information as regards the place of business within the 
meaning of point (b) to avoid any legal uncertainty. This is not only relevant for the proprietor but 
also for third parties for whom incorrect information may have adverse legal consequences.

A place of business provided together with the request for unitary effect under Rule 16(1)(w) UPR
will not be displayed in the Register for unitary patent protection if the UPCA has not taken effect in 
the indicated participating Member State at the date of registration of unitary effect by the EPO 
(Arts. 7(1) and 18(2) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012).

2.2.7.
Translation

The request for unitary effect must contain a translation of the European patent as required under 
Art. 6(1) Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012. Where the language of the proceedings is French or 
German, a full translation of the specification of the European patent into English must be submitted.
Where the language of the proceedings is English, a full translation of the specification of the 
European patent into any other official language of the European Union must be submitted.

A full translation of the specification of the European patent is required. Under Rule 73(1) EPC, the 
specification of the European patent includes the description, the claims and any drawings. 
Therefore, the translation of the description, the claims and any text in the drawings needs to be 
filed.

The translated text has no legal effect and is for information only (Art. 6(2) Regulation (EU) 
No 1260/2012). For that reason, the translation does not have to be certified.

In cases where claims and/or the description are amended in subsequent opposition or limitation 
proceedings, there is no requirement to file a further amended translation for a registered Unitary 
Patent.

In principle, sequence listings do not need to be translated, irrespective of whether they appear or 
are merely referred to in the B publication. Should the circumstances of a case require that a 
translation of the sequence listing be filed under Rule 6(2)(d) UPR, the UPP Division will issue an 
invitation to the proprietor to file such a translation.

The translations are placed in the public part of the file relating to the Unitary Patent.


Unitary Patent Guidelines 
Draft

14

2.2.7.1. Format

The translation should be drawn up in a form enabling it to be disseminated, i.e. it should be 
typewritten or printed (Art. 6(2) Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012; Rule 50(2) EPC, which applies
mutatis mutandis pursuant to Rule 20(2)(c) UPR).

The requirements under Rule 50(2) EPC for the presentation of the translation in European patent 
proceedings apply mutatis mutandis to Unitary Patent proceedings pursuant to Rule 20(2)(c) UPR
(see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 November 2022, OJ EPO 2022, A113).

2.2.7.2. Correction

The UPP Division does not check the translation's accuracy as it has no legal effect and is for 
information purposes only. After the submission of the translation, linguistic errors, errors of 
transcription and mistakes may be corrected on request (Rule 20(2)(h) UPR in conjunction with 
Rule 139, first sentence, EPC).

2.3.
Filing the request for unitary effect

2.3.1.
How to file the request for unitary effect

The request for unitary effect should preferably be filed online using EPO Form 7000 in the EPO's 
online filing tools. Detailed descriptions of the various options can be found on the EPO website (see 
Filing options on epo.org; see also EPC Guidelines, A-II, 1.1).

The request for unitary effect can also be filed in person or by postal services with the EPO at its 
headquarters (Isar) and PschorrHöfe buildings in Munich, its branch at The Hague and its Berlin 
sub-office. However, it cannot be filed at the EPO sub-offices in Vienna and Brussels, and it cannot 
be filed with the central industrial property office or competent authority of an EPC contracting state 
(Rule 6(1) UPR). Fax is not a permitted means of filing at the EPO. Requests for unitary effect filed 
by fax are therefore deemed not to have been received (see OJ EPO 2024, A41, and OJ EPO 2024, 
A42).

2.3.2.
Acknowledgement of receipt

The receipt of a request for unitary effect filed online is acknowledged electronically following its 
submission. Where such an acknowledgement is not successfully transmitted, the UPP Division will 
transmit it by other means without delay, provided it has sufficient information to do so (Art. 13 of the 
decision of the President of the EPO dated 3 May 2023). The acknowledgement of receipt is also 
issued on paper for requests for unitary effect submitted on paper.

2.4.
Processing of the request for unitary effect

If the request for unitary effect is filed after the one-month time limit under Rule 6(1) UPR, the UPP 
Division will reject the request. Re-establishment of rights in respect of this period may be requested 
(see 4).

If the time limit for filing the request for unitary effect under Rule 6(1) UPR and the requirements 
under Rule 5(2) UPR are met, but the request for unitary effect fails to comply with the requirements 
under Rule 6(2) UPR, the UPP Division will give the proprietor an opportunity to comply with the 
outstanding requirements within a non-extendable period of one month (Rule 7(3) UPR). 
Re-establishment of rights in respect of this new period cannot be requested and no other legal 
remedy is available (Rule 22(6) UPR).


Unitary Patent Guidelines 
Draft

15

If the requirements under Rule 5(2) UPR are not met or the request for unitary effect was filed more 
than one month after the mention of the grant of the European patent in the European Patent Bulletin 
(Rule 6(1) UPR) and no request for re-establishment was filed, or one was filed but rejected, the 
UPP Division will issue an intention to reject the request for unitary effect (Rule 7(2) UPR) and will 
invite the proprietor to comment at least once in accordance with Art. 113(1) EPC, which applies 
mutatis mutandis pursuant to Rule 20(1) UPR.

If the request for unitary effect fails to comply with any other formal requirements, the UPP Division 
will give the proprietor an opportunity to remedy the deficiencies. If the deficiencies are not remedied, 
the request for unitary effect will be rejected (Rule 7(3) UPR).

2.5.
Registration of the unitary effect

If the requirements under Rule 5(2) UPR are met (see 2.1) and the request for unitary effect complies 
with the formal requirements set out in Rule 6 UPR, the UPP Division will register the unitary effect 
and communicate the date of registration to the requester via EPO Form 7030 (Rule 7(1) UPR). The 
Unitary Patent takes effect on the date of the publication of the mention of the grant of the European 
patent in the European Patent Bulletin (Art. 4(1) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012).

2.6.
Rejection of the request for unitary effect

The UPP Division will take a final decision rejecting the request for unitary effect if the requirements 
under Rule 5(2) UPR are not met or the request for unitary effect does not comply with Rule 6(1)
UPR, provided that no request for re-establishment of rights has been filed (see 4) or the request for 
re-establishment of rights was rejected (Rule 7(2) UPR) and no response was submitted to the 
intention to reject the request for unitary effect.

The UPP Division will also take a final decision rejecting the request for unitary effect if the 
outstanding formal requirements under Rule 6(2) UPR were not remedied within the non-extendable 
period of one month (Rule 7(3) UPR).

Where a request for unitary effect is rejected by either the EPO or the UPC or where the unitary 
effect is revoked by the UPC after expiry of the deadlines for validating the European patent, the 
safety net mechanism may provide the possibility to validate the European patent in one or more of 
the relevant participating Member States. Information on the safety net can be found in chapter II of 
National measures relating to the Unitary Patent.

2.7.
Withdrawal of the request for unitary effect

A request for unitary effect may be withdrawn as long as the UPP Division has not taken a decision, 
i.e. to register unitary effect or reject the request (see Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2023, 
5). A communication confirming the withdrawal of the request for unitary effect will be issued by the 
UPP Division.

Fees and compensation

3.1.
Fees

3.1.1.
General

The RFeesUPP set out the amounts of the fees and expenses due to the EPO as provided for in the 
UPR and the fees and expenses laid down by the President of the EPO (OJ EPO 2022, A42). 

Most of the important provisions of the RFees under the EPC apply equally to the Unitary Patent, 
particularly those governing the payment of fees at the EPO (Art. 6 RFeesUPP).

Fees for Unitary Patents can be paid using the same means of payment as those available in 
European patent proceedings, including deposit accounts held with the EPO. The ADA and their 
annexes are applicable (see Supplementary publication 3, OJ EPO 2023 and OJ EPO 2024, A81).

Whilst the request for unitary effect is free of charge, i.e. no filing, examination or registration fees 
are due, other fees such as renewal fees are to be paid to the EPO (see 3.1.7).

3.1.2.
Unitary Patent fees

The Unitary Patent fees are, in particular:

−
renewal fees (Art. 2(1), item 1, RFeesUPP)

−
additional fee for late payment of a renewal fee (Art. 2(1), item 2, RFeesUPP)

−
fee for re-establishment of rights (Art. 2(2) RFeesUPP)

−
administrative fee to be paid where compensation for translation costs was based on a false 
declaration (Art. 4(2) RFeesUPP)

−
other fees, expenses and prices not specified in the UPR and laid down by the President of 
the EPO, such as the fee for registering transfers, licences and other rights (Art. 5
RFeesUPP).

3.1.3.
Methods of payment and currency

The fees due must be paid to the EPO in euros via any of the accepted payment methods. Payments
can be made by debit from a deposit account held with the EPO, credit card or bank transfer.

All of these payment methods can be accessed via Central Fee Payment, the EPO website or 
MyEPO Portfolio. Fees may be validly paid by any person, i.e. there is no need to appoint a 
representative for this. Information relating to fees and methods of payment, including the EPO bank 
account for payments in euros, can also be found on the EPO website.

New automatic debiting requests and refund instructions will need to be filed for the Unitary Patent
procedure as existing instructions for European patent applications do not automatically extend to 
the Unitary Patent procedure.

3.1.4.
Due date for the payment of fees

With the exception of renewal fees (see 3.1.7), due dates for the payment of fees related to Unitary 
Patents follow the same principle as for European patent applications, namely the first day on which 
the fees may validly be paid, not the last day of a period for such payment. If no due date is specified, 


Unitary Patent Guidelines 
Draft
April 2025

17

the fee is due on the date of receipt of the request for the service incurring the fee concerned (Art. 4 
RFees; see EPC Guidelines, A-X, 5.1.1).

Rule 134 EPC applies mutatis mutandis for the calculation of valid payment of fees.

3.1.5.
Reduction of fees

A reduction of 15% of the renewal fees is granted as long as a statement by the proprietor offering 
a licence of right is registered (see 6.5). As a result, the reduction is not applied if the statement is 
subsequently withdrawn (see 6.5.2).

3.1.6.
Refund of fees

New refund instructions must be included in the request for unitary effect. Existing refund instructions 
for European patent applications do not apply to the Unitary Patent procedure.

The EPO refunds incorrect or undue fees to any deposit account that the party to the proceedings 
indicates in its refund instructions. Deposit accounts held by a third party may also be indicated. 
Refund instructions must be filed in an electronically processable format (XML), namely via EPO 
Online Filing or Online Filing 2.0, as early as possible, preferably using EPO Form 7000. Refund 
instructions can be updated at any time, using EPO Form 7038.

Where the EPO cannot make a refund to a deposit account and where the party to the proceedings 
or their authorised representative is a user of MyEPO Portfolio, the refund can be claimed directly in 
Central Fee Payment. The EPO will inform the party to the proceedings, via a communication to their 
Mailbox in MyEPO Portfolio, that a refund is pending and can be claimed in Central Fee Payment.

Where the EPO cannot make a refund to a deposit account and where the refund recipient is not a 
user of MyEPO Portfolio, the party to the proceedings is invited to claim the refund in Central Fee 
Payment with a refund code.

Where no refund instructions are on file and a refund is pending or, where applicable, a 
compensation request is to be credited to a bank account, the party to the proceedings is invited to 
claim the refund in Central Fee Payment with a refund code (OJ EPO 2024, A23).

3.1.7.
Renewal fees

Renewal fees due for Unitary Patents and any additional fees for their late payment must be paid to 
the EPO. They are due in respect of the years following the year in which the mention of the grant 
of the European patent is published in the European Patent Bulletin (Rule 13(1) UPR). The proprietor
of a Unitary Patent pays one single renewal fee direct to the EPO, in one currency and under a single 
legal regime as regards deadlines and admissible means of payment.

3.1.7.1. Due date for renewal fees

The due dates for renewal fees for Unitary Patents are in line with the system in place for European 
patent applications under Rule 51(1) EPC. A renewal fee for a Unitary Patent in respect of the coming 
year will be due on the last day of the month containing the anniversary of the date of filing of the 
European patent application which led to the Unitary Patent. Renewal fees cannot be validly paid 
more than three months before they fall due (Rule 13(2) UPR).


Unitary Patent Guidelines

3.1.7.2. Additional six-month period for paying renewal fees

If a renewal fee is not paid in due time, it may still be paid within six months of the due date, provided 
that an additional fee (50% of the renewal fee (Art. 2(1), item 2, RFeesUPP)) is also paid within that 
period (Rule 13(3) UPR). 

The EPO will send a reminder to the proprietor as a courtesy service. Consequently, the proprietor 
may not invoke the omission of this reminder.

3.1.7.3. Missing payment after additional six-month period for paying renewal fees

The six-month additional period under Rule 13(3) UPR starts on the due day as referred to in 
Rule 13(2) UPR, even if the EPO cannot receive mail on that date because of holidays, a mail 
interruption or a strike. However, Rule 134(1) EPC will apply to the expiry of the six-month additional 
period such that the last day for valid payment will again be deferred to the first working day thereafter 
(see Rule 20(2)(g) UPR; OJ EPO 1992, 402; Rules 131 and 134 EPC).

When calculating the additional period under Rule 13(3) UPR, the established practice of the EPO 
is applied (EPC Guidelines, A-X, 5.2.4). It follows that the six-month period for the payment of a 
renewal fee with an additional fee expires on the last day of the sixth month after the due date in the 
light of Rule 13(2) UPR, and not on the day of that month corresponding in number to the due date. 
Thus, the calculation is to be made from the last day of the month to the last day of the sixth month 
thereafter (e.g. if the due date is 28 February, then the end of the six-month period will be 31 August 
and not 28 August; Rules 14(1)(b) and 14(2) UPR).

If the renewal fee is not paid within the additional six-month period referred to in 3.1.7.2, the EPO 
will send a communication under Rule 112(1) EPC (which applies mutatis mutandis pursuant to 
Rule 20(2)(d) UPR) notifying the proprietor of a loss of rights.

Failure to pay the renewal fee within the additional six-month period can be redressed by 
re-establishment of rights under Rule 22 UPR (see 4). 

A review of the finding of the EPO causing the loss of rights may be requested by applying for a 
decision under Rule 112(2) EPC. An action against that decision can be brought before the UPC 
(Art. 32(1)(i) UPCA).

3.1.7.4. Lapse of the Unitary Patent due to non-payment of the renewal fee 

Non-payment of the renewal fee and of any additional fee results in the lapse of the Unitary Patent 
(Rule 14(1)(b) UPR). The lapse is then deemed to have occurred on the date on which the renewal 
fee was due (Rule 14(2) UPR).

3.1.7.5. Special features relating to renewal fees

3.1.7.5.1.
Three-month safety period under Rule 13(4) UPR

A Unitary Patent renewal fee that falls due within three months of the notification of the 
communication referred to in Rule 7(1) UPR (i.e. EPO Form 7030, informing the requester of the 
date of registration of unitary effect) may be paid within that three-month period without any additional 
fee under Rule 13(3) UPR (see also Rule 13(4) UPR). This three-month period does not change the 


Unitary Patent Guidelines 
Draft
April 2025

19

start of the six-month additional period for paying the renewal fee with an additional fee (Rule 13(3)
UPR). With respect to the date of notification of a communication, the established practice of the 
EPO applies (see EPC Guidelines, E-II, 2).

3.1.7.5.2.
Renewal fee falling due between the grant of the European patent and 

the notification of the registration of unitary effect 

Once the EPO has notified the patent proprietor of the decision to register unitary effect, the Unitary 
Patent takes effect on the date of the publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent 
in the European Patent Bulletin in accordance with Art. 4(1) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 (see also 
Recital 8 Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012, Rules 7(1) and 13(3) and (5) UPR).

A renewal fee may fall due after the date of the publication of the mention of the grant of the European 
patent in the European Patent Bulletin but before or on the day of the notification of the registration 
of the unitary effect by the EPO (Rules 7(1) and 13(5) UPR). In such cases, the due date for the 
payment of the renewal fee is shifted to the date of the notification of the registration. The renewal 
fee may be paid within three months of this notification without any additional fee (Rule 13(5) UPR).
If it is not paid within this three-month period, the renewal fee can still be paid with an additional fee 
within six months from the date of notification of the communication referred to in Rule 7(1) UPR
(Rule 13(3) UPR).

3.1.7.5.3.
Renewal fee falling due after lapse of the unitary effect

Pursuant to Rule 13(6) UPR, Rule 51(4) EPC applies mutatis mutandis where a Unitary Patent
lapses due to non-payment of the renewal fee within the applicable time limit and the right is 
subsequently re-established.

3.2.
Compensation scheme

A compensation scheme is in place to cover the costs of translation in the pre-grant phase of 
European and Euro-PCT patent applications that were filed in one of the official languages of the 
European Union other than the three official languages of the EPO (Art. 5 Regulation (EU) 
No 1260/2012).

3.2.1.
Eligibility requirements

3.2.1.1. Residence, principal place of business

To be eligible for compensation for translation costs, the proprietor(s) of the Unitary Patent and – in 
case of change of ownership – the initial applicant(s) must have (had) their residence or principal 
place of business in an EU Member State. It does not matter if the EU Member State is not 
participating in the Unitary Patent system.

3.2.1.2. Applicant/proprietor categories

Furthermore, the proprietor(s) and, where applicable, the initial applicant(s) must either be a natural 
person or fall within one of the following categories as provided for in Rule 8(2) UPR:

−
small and medium-sized enterprises as defined in European Commission Recommendation 
2003/361/EC dated 6 May 2003 or

−
non-profit organisations as defined in Art. 2(1)(14) Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 or


Unitary Patent Guidelines 
Draft
April 2025

20

−
universities or public research organisations.

Universities and public research organisations are not expressly defined in any EU legislation but a 
definition – as well as more details on the definitions of small and medium-sized enterprises and 
non-profit organisations – can be found in the notice from the EPO dated 25 January 2024 (OJ EPO 
2024, A8).

3.2.1.3. Transfer of the European patent application during the grant procedure

If the request for compensation is submitted by the same entity as the one that filed the European 
patent application, the eligibility criteria must be fulfilled at the time of filing the European patent 
application (Art. 5 Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012; Recital 10 Regulation (EU) No 1260/2012).

If there are multiple proprietors, the compensation will be granted only if each proprietor fulfils the 
eligibility criteria (Rule 8(3) UPR).

Where the European patent application or the European patent was transferred before the request 
for unitary effect was filed, the compensation will be granted only if both the initial applicant and the 
new proprietor (in the latter's case, at the time of requesting compensation) fulfil the eligibility criteria 
(Rule 8(4) UPR).

3.2.1.4. Filing language requirement

To qualify for the compensation scheme, the European patent application for which the Unitary 
Patent was granted must have been filed in an official language of the European Union other than 
English, French or German (Rule 8(1) UPR).

The compensation scheme applies not only to European patent applications filed at the EPO but 
also to Euro-PCT applications originally filed at a PCT receiving Office (Art. 153 EPC) in an official 
language of the European Union other than English, French or German (Rule 8(5) UPR).

3.2.2.
Filing of the request for compensation

3.2.2.1. Formal requirements

The proprietor must file an express request for compensation to benefit from the scheme.

The request for compensation must be filed together with the request for unitary effect, i.e. no later 
than one month after the publication of the mention of the grant of the European patent in the 
European Patent Bulletin (Rule 9(1) UPR). It must contain a declaration that the proprietor and, if 
applicable, the initial applicant is a natural person or one of the entities as provided for in Rule 8(2)
UPR.

All the options for filing the request for unitary effect include a checkbox for simultaneously requesting 
the compensation and making the required declaration of eligible status, making it easy in practice 
to request compensation. If the request is not filed electronically or using the checkbox, it must be 
filed in writing and fulfil the requirements under Rule 50(2) and (3) EPC, which applies mutatis 
mutandis pursuant to Rule 20(2)(c) UPR.

3.2.3.
Processing of the request for compensation

3.2.3.1. Examination of the request for compensation

The UPP Division will examine the request for compensation and notify the proprietor if it can be 
granted.

A compensation request can only be granted once the unitary effect has been registered (Rule 10(1)
UPR). Once compensation has been granted, the proprietor retains it regardless of any possible 
subsequent change in status, i.e. even if, for instance, they no longer fulfil the eligibility requirements
(see 3.2.1) or assign their Unitary Patent to a new proprietor who does not meet the eligibility 
requirements (Rule 10(2) UPR).

3.2.3.2. Grant of the request for compensation

The compensation amount is defined in Art. 4 RFeesUPP and amounts to EUR 500. It is paid as a 
lump sum (Rule 11 UPR in conjunction with Art. 4(1) RFeesUPP) into the proprietor's deposit account 
indicated on the request. Where no deposit account information has been provided, the proprietor 
can claim the compensation amount online and request that it be credited to a bank account of their 
choice.

3.2.3.3. Rejection of the request for compensation

The request for compensation will be rejected where:

−
no unitary effect has been registered or the request was validly withdrawn

−
the initial applicant(s) had their principal place of business in a state which is not a member 
of the EU

−
the proprietor of the Unitary Patent has their place of business in a state that is not a member 
state of the EU

−
the European patent application/Euro-PCT application was originally filed in English, French 
or German

−
the European patent application/Euro-PCT application was originally filed in a language 
(other than English, French or German) which is not an official language of the EU or

−
the proprietor and, where applicable, the initial applicant do not fall within one of the 
categories provided for in Rule 8(2) UPR.

If any of the deficiencies mentioned above are identified in the request, the proprietor will be notified 
through a communication concerning Rule 10(1) UPR (EPO Form 7040A). They will be invited to 
provide comments and/or supporting evidence within a time limit to be specified.

If the request for compensation is not withdrawn or if no satisfying evidence or comments are 
received, a decision to reject the request for compensation will be issued by the UPP Division. An 
action against such a decision can be lodged before the UPC (Rules 87 to 88 RoP UPC; see 2.6).

3.2.3.4. Doubts as to the veracity of the declaration filed under Rule 9(2) UPR

The UPP Division will conduct checks to ensure compliance with the eligibility requirements, i.e. 
whether the initial applicant(s), if applicable, and the proprietor(s) of the Unitary Patent fall within one 
of the categories provided for in Rule 8(2) UPR.


Unitary Patent Guidelines

If no information is found to confirm compliance with the eligibility requirements or if the information 
found raises doubts as to the veracity of the declaration filed under Rule 9(2) UPR, the UPP Division
will request appropriate evidence confirming the status of the applicant(s)/proprietor(s) (Rule 10(3) 
and (4) UPR). Such evidence may take the form of an extract from the commercial register or other 
official documents.

If the evidence filed
contains sufficient information to confirm that the status of the 

applicant(s)/proprietor(s) fulfils the eligibility requirements, the request for compensation will be 
allowed.

If no or insufficient evidence is filed, the requester will be informed about the intention to reject their 
request, giving them the possibility to comment under Art. 113(1) EPC, which applies mutatis 
mutandis pursuant to Rule 20(1) UPR. If, after expiry of the time limit, the request still cannot be 
granted, a final decision to reject the request for compensation will be issued (see 3.2.3.3).

If the UPP Division finds that the request for compensation was granted on the basis of a false 
declaration, the proprietor will be required to pay an additional fee composed of the compensation 
amount paid and an administrative fee (amounting to 50% of the compensation amount; Rule 10(4) 
UPR and Art. 4(2) RFeesUPP) with the next renewal fee falling due for their Unitary Patent. Failure 
to repay the compensation amount and the administrative fee will result in the lapse of the Unitary 
Patent (Rules 10(4) and 14 UPR).

3.2.4.
Withdrawal of the request for compensation 

The request for compensation may be withdrawn as long as the UPP Division has not yet taken a 
decision on it. The withdrawal must be filed in writing and be signed by an authorised person (see 
2.2.5 and 7.2.5).

Re-establishment of rights

A proprietor of a European patent or of a Unitary Patent who, despite taking all due care required by 
the circumstances, was unable to observe a time limit vis-à-vis the EPO may request the 
re-establishment of their rights. A "time limit" is taken to mean a specific period within which an act 
vis-à-vis the EPO must be completed (see EPC Guidelines, E-VIII, 1.1).

4.1.
Scope

Re-establishment of rights may be requested only for cases where non-observance of the time limit
is the direct cause of either the Unitary Patent's lapse under Rule 14(1)(b) UPR or a loss of any other 
right or means of redress.

The main circumstances giving rise to re-establishment of rights in proceedings before the UPP
Division are filing the request for unitary effect too late and failing to duly pay renewal fees for the 
Unitary Patent (see 2.3 and 3.1.7 respectively). In the case of a late-filed request for unitary effect, 
the European patent proprietor may be able to obtain re-establishment of rights in respect of the 
non-extendable one-month period specified in Rule 6(1) UPR. Re-establishment of rights may also 
be requested if the time limit for the following acts is missed:

−
filing of a request for compensation (Rule 9(1) UPR)

−
payment of the overdue compensation amount owed and the related administrative fee 
(Rule 10(4) UPR)

−
submitting a request for a decision (Rule 112 EPC, which applies mutatis mutandis pursuant 
to Rule 20(2)(d) UPR).

Re-establishment of rights is not available in respect of the period for requesting re-establishment of 
rights or the correction of deficiencies (see 2.4). Where the Unitary Patent proprietor failed to observe 
the time limit for paying the renewal fees under Rule 13(2) UPR, they can still comply with that 
requirement by paying the renewal fee with the additional fee under Rule 13(3) UPR. Therefore, as
no direct loss of rights occurs in those circumstances, re-establishment of rights is not applicable.

4.2.
Admissibility

The admissibility of a request for re-establishment of rights is assessed in accordance with the 
applicable provisions of the UPR as well as the established practice of the EPO based on the case 
law of the EPO boards of appeal on Art. 122 EPC and Rule 136 EPC.

4.2.1.
Entitlement to file

The request may be filed by the proprietor of a European patent or of a Unitary Patent or their duly 
appointed representative (see 7.2). In the case of the transfer of a Unitary Patent, the request for 
re-establishment of rights may only be filed by the registered proprietor (see 2.2.2).

4.2.2.
Time limit

The request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for filing the request for unitary 
effect must be filed at the latest within two months of expiry of that period regardless of the date of 
removal of the cause of non-compliance (Rule 22(2) UPR). The one-year period for requesting
re-establishment of rights that starts upon expiry of the unobserved time limit does not apply in cases
where the expired time limit relates to the filing of a request for unitary effect.


Unitary Patent Guidelines 
Draft
April 2025

24

Requests for re-establishment of rights in respect of the other time limits subject to re-establishment
must be filed within two months of the removal of the cause of non-compliance with the time limit, 
but at the latest within one year of expiry of the unobserved time limit. Refer to the EPC Guidelines
for more information on removal of the cause of non-compliance (see EPC Guidelines, E-VIII, 3.1.3).

The request for reestablishment of rights will not be deemed to have been filed until the prescribed 
fee has been paid (Rule 22(2) UPR).

4.2.3.
Form

The request for re-establishment of rights must be filed in writing. The omitted act must be completed 
within the time limit for filing the request for re-establishment. In the case of a request for 
re-establishment of rights in respect of the time limit for requesting unitary effect, the omitted act that 
must be performed is the filing of the request for unitary effect (see 2.1). 

4.2.4.
Substantiation

The request for re-establishment of rights will not be deemed admissible if not sufficiently 
substantiated. A sufficiently substantiated request will state the grounds on which it is based and set 
out the facts on which it relies. Certain specific elements are therefore expected to be included in 
the statement of grounds, namely (non-exhaustively): the precise cause of non-compliance, when 
and under which circumstances the cause occurred and was removed and the core facts making it 
possible to assess whether all due care required by the circumstances were taken.

A request relying only on general statements and containing no specific facts does not satisfy the 
requirement for a duly substantiated request (Rule 136(2) EPC and decision J 15/10 of the Legal Board 
of Appeal). A duly substantiated statement of grounds must be submitted within the time limit for filing 
the request for re-establishment.

Refer to the EPC Guidelines for further information on substantiation in the context of 
re-establishment of rights at the EPO (see EPC Guidelines, E-VIII, 3.1.4).

4.3.
Allowability

European patent or Unitary Patent proprietors can only have their rights re-established if they can 
show that they acted with all due care required by the circumstances in their attempt to observe the 
missed time limit. All due care means all reasonable care, which is the standard of care that the 
notional reasonable competent proprietor or their representative would employ in all relevant 
circumstances. The proprietor will normally have to prove that the failure to meet the time limit results 
either from exceptional circumstances or from an isolated mistake within a normally satisfactory 
monitoring system.

Even when the existence of exceptional circumstances is proven or when non-compliance with the 
time limit can be traced back to an isolated mistake, all due care must have been taken by all the 
parties involved (e.g. proprietor, representative, assistants, etc.). This requirement is fulfilled, for 
example, when an assistant makes an error despite having been carefully selected, instructed and 
supervised by the representative.

Refer to the EPC Guidelines for further information on the application of the due care criteria at the 
EPO (see EPC Guidelines, E-VIII, 3.2).

4.4.
Decision on re-establishment of rights

Decisions on requests for re-establishment of rights are taken by the UPP Division. If all the
requirements are met and the request is granted, the proprietor is informed accordingly (EPO Form 
7115). If the request is granted, the legal consequences of the failure to observe the time limit will be 
deemed not to have ensued.

If the request for re-establishment cannot be granted, for instance if it is deemed inadmissible or not 
allowable, the UPP Division issues first a communication (Art. 113 EPC, which applies mutatis 
mutandis pursuant to Rule 20(1) UPR). The communication informs the proprietor of the UPP
Division's intention to reject the request for re-establishment and includes the statement of the
grounds for the intended rejection. The proprietor is then invited to file any comments or supporting 
evidence within a non-extendable time limit of one month from receipt of the communication. The 
proprietor's response may be taken into account only if it is submitted within the time limit set and if
it does not extend beyond or alter the facts and grounds as presented in the original request. If 
needed, the UPP Division may invite the proprietor to file further comments or supporting evidence 
prior to taking a final decision.

After considering all duly presented facts and evidence, the UPP Division takes a final decision to 
grant or reject the request for re-establishment. A decision to grant the request is communicated to 
the proprietor via EPO Form 7155 unless a reasoned decision to reject the request is to be issued 
(EPO Form 7099). Grounds for a decision will only be provided if the request is rejected. An action 
against such decision can be lodged before the UPC under Arts. 32(1)(i) and 66 UPCA (see 7.7.1). 
Attention is also drawn to Rules 88 to 97 RoP UPC.

Where re-establishment has been requested in respect of the period specified in Rule 6(1) UPR, and 
the UPP Division decided to reject the request, the UPP Division will issue an intention to reject the 
request for unitary effect, citing the grounds for that decision. The proprietor will have the opportunity 
to file comments within a non-extendable time limit of one month. Upon expiry of this time limit, a 
decision on the request for unitary effect will be issued (see 2.4).

5.
Interruption and resumption of proceedings

5.1.
General

Interruption and resumption of proceedings before the UPP Division are subject to the provisions of 
Rule 142 EPC, which apply mutatis mutandis pursuant to Rule 20(2)(i) UPR (see EPC Guidelines, 
E-VII, 1.1 and 1.4). The UPP Division bears responsibility for the interruption and resumption of 
proceedings related to Unitary Patents.

In principle, the UPP Division interrupts proceedings pursuant to Rule 142 EPC ex officio. In the case 
of Rule 142(1)(a), last sentence, EPC, however, proceedings are interrupted on request of the 
authorised representative only. The UPP Division will assess each case on the basis of Rule 142 
EPC and the established practice of the EPO with a view to protecting parties who are prevented by
legal reasons from acting in proceedings against a loss of rights which would otherwise occur 
(decision J 16/05 of the Legal Board of Appeal).

Time limits in force on the date of interruption of the proceedings begin again, in their original length, 
as from the day on which the proceedings are resumed, with the exception of the time limits for 
paying renewal fees. The EPO's established practice under Rule 142(4) EPC applies mutatis 
mutandis pursuant to Rule 20(2)(i) UPR (see EPC Guidelines, E-VII, 1.5).

5.2.
Date of interruption and resumption of proceedings

An interruption is registered (in general retroactively) with legal effect from the date of the occurrence 
of the event. In cases where proceedings are interrupted on request, the interruption takes effect as 
from the date of receipt of the request by the UPP Division (see EPC Guidelines, E-VII, 1.3 and 1.4).

The parties are informed of the interruption of proceedings and the reasons for it. The date of 
interruption as well as the date of resumption of proceedings are recorded in the Register for unitary 
patent protection (Rule 16(1)(u) UPR).

5.3.
Stay of proceedings

The President of the EPO may decide ex officio under Rule 3 UPR to take the precaution of staying 
proceedings for the registration of unitary effect in the Register for unitary patent protection in specific 
situations. If proceedings are stayed, the EPO will inform the parties accordingly. It will also withdraw 
any communications setting them time limits for reacting and refrain from dispatching any other such 
communications until the proceedings have been resumed (e.g. Notice from the European Patent 
Office dated 10 July 2024 concerning the staying of proceedings for the registration of unitary effect 
as a precautionary measure due to the EU's 14th package of sanctions against Russia (OJ EPO 
2024, A70)).

The President of the EPO may decide at any point in time that registration proceedings which have 
been stayed are to be resumed (e.g. Notice from the European Patent Office dated 13 November 
2024 concerning the implementation of the 14th package of EU sanctions against Russia in 
procedures related to the Unitary Patent and the amendment to the associated amendment to the 
Rules relating to Unitary Patent Protection (OJ EPO 2024, A97); see 2.1).

6.
Registration of changes of name and address, transfers, licences 
and other rights

6.1.
General

Rights and the transfer of rights relating to Unitary Patents are registered at the request of an 
interested party in the Register for unitary patent protection by the UPP Division (Rules 22 to 24 
EPC, which apply mutatis mutandis pursuant to Rule 20(2)(b) UPR; Rule 16(1)(j) UPR).

Changes to the particulars of the proprietors are also recorded in the Register for unitary patent 
protection by the UPP Division, in accordance with Rule 16(1)(j) UPR.

6.2.
Transfer of the Unitary Patent

A Unitary Patent may be transferred only in respect of all the participating Member States for which 
the Unitary Patent is registered (Art. 3(2) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012).

Transfers are recorded in the Register for unitary patent protection at the request of an interested 
party and on production of documents satisfying the EPO that they have taken place.

The registration of the transfer may be subject to an administrative fee under the conditions laid 
down by the President of the EPO pursuant to Rule 22(2) EPC (OJ EPO 2024, A5). No administrative 
fee is due where a request for registration under Rule 20(2)(b) UPR in conjunction with Rule 22 EPC
is filed via MyEPO Portfolio. Where the request is filed via other means, the administrative fee 
remains due. In the latter case, the request is not deemed to have been filed until the administrative 
fee has been paid (see EPC Guidelines, A-X, 2). The amount of the fee is determined by the latest 
schedule of fees and expenses of the EPO (see epo.org).

Where a fee is due and the request relates to multiple Unitary Patents, a separate fee must be paid 
for each Unitary Patent. Simultaneous payment for multiple Unitary Patents is only possible using 
the batch functionality in Central Fee Payment (see the notice from the EPO dated 19 July 2022,
OJ EPO 2022, A81). Where batch payment was attempted via any other means, e.g. by editing the 
amount to be paid on EPO Form 7038 filed electronically, the transfer will be registered for the first 
Unitary Patent only and the overpayment will be refunded. Payment of the fee due in respect of each 
of the Unitary Patents for which the batch payment failed will need to be effected again, which will 
lead to different dates of legal effect. 

Where a fee is due and the request for registration of a transfer of rights affects both the Unitary 
Patent and the European patent for the remaining EPC contracting states not territorially covered by 
the unitary effect, only one administrative fee is due.

Any kind of written evidence suitable to prove the transfer is admissible. This includes formal 
documentary proof such as the instrument of transfer itself (original or a copy thereof) or other official 
documents or extracts thereof, provided they immediately verify the transfer. The evidence may be 
filed in any language. The EPO may, however, require a translation into one of its official languages 
(Rule 3(3) EPC).

Refer to the EPC Guidelines for further information on the formal requirements for requesting a 
transfer and the evidence to be filed alongside the request (see EPC Guidelines, E-XIV, 3 and 4).


Unitary Patent Guidelines 
Draft
April 2025

28

For the formal requirements for signatures and authorisations, see 7.2.5 and 7.3.

6.3.
Changes of name

Mere changes of name, i.e. changes that do not involve a modification of the legal identity of the 
proprietor, can be entered in the Register for unitary patent protection upon request and production 
of relevant documentary evidence as long as the Unitary Patent proceedings before the EPO are 
pending. Such registration is free of charge.

6.4.
Licences and other rights

6.4.1.
Registration

A Unitary Patent may be licensed in respect of the whole or part of the territories of the participating 
Member States (Art. 3(2) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012). It may, in respect of all participating 
Member States, give rise to rights in rem and may be the subject of legal means of execution.

Rules 23 and 24 EPC apply mutatis mutandis pursuant to Rule 20(2)(b) UPR to the registration of 
the grant, establishment or transfer of such rights and any legal means of execution affecting a 
Unitary Patent. A licence will be recorded in the Register for unitary patent protection as an exclusive 
licence if the proprietor and the licensee request it. A licence will be recorded as a sub-licence where 
it is granted by a licensee whose licence is already recorded in the Register for unitary patent 
protection.

A request to record an exclusive licence in the Register for unitary patent protection is no longer 
admissible once a statement concerning licences of right has been filed unless that statement is 
withdrawn (Rule 12(4) UPR).

As to the standard of proof applying to the registration of licences and other rights, any legal means
of execution and any administrative fees due, see EPC Guidelines, E-XIV, 3 and 6.

If the request complies with the requirements of Rule 20(2)(b) UPR, the licence or other right is 
registered with the date on which the request, the required evidence or, where applicable, the fee 
has been received by the EPO, whichever is the latest.

6.4.2.
Cancellation

A registration of licences or other rights may be cancelled upon request, on production either of 
documents satisfying the UPP Division that the right has lapsed or been declared invalid, or of a 
declaration of the proprietor of the right that they consent to the cancellation (Rule 23(2) EPC, which 
applies mutatis mutandis pursuant to Rule 20(2)(b) UPR). The cancellation may be subject to the 
payment of an administrative fee. Where the request is filed via MyEPO Portfolio, no fee is due (see 
the decision of the President of the EPO dated 25 January 2024, OJ EPO 2024, A5). A fee is due for 
requests filed via other means, in which case, the request is deemed not to have been filed until the 
administrative fee has been paid (see EPC Guidelines, A-X, 2). Cancellation of a registration is only 
possible if the Unitary Patent has not lapsed.


Unitary Patent Guidelines 
Draft
April 2025

6.4.3.
Deficiencies

If the request or evidence submitted for registration or cancellation of a licence or other right is found 
to be insufficient, the UPP Division will inform the party concerned accordingly and request of them
to remedy the deficiencies found within a period to be specified. Failure to rectify the deficiency in 
time leads to refusal of the request.

6.5.
Statement on licences of right

6.5.1.
Registration

Proprietors of a Unitary Patent may file a statement with the EPO to the effect that they are prepared 
to allow any person to use their invention as a licensee in return for appropriate consideration 
(Art. 8(1) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 and Rule 12(1) UPR). A licence obtained under the system 
of licences of right will be treated as a contractual licence (Art. 8(2) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012). 
This statement can be filed using EPO Form 7001 or as a free-text letter. No administrative fee is 
due and the statement will be entered in the Register for unitary patent protection free of charge.

A statement cannot be registered as long as an exclusive licence is recorded in the Register for 
unitary patent protection or a request for recording of such a licence is pending with the UPP Division
(Rule 12(3) UPR).

Renewal fees for a Unitary Patent which fall due after receipt of a statement under Rule 12(1) UPR
will be reduced by 15% (Art. 3 RFeesUPP). Any additional fee for belated payment of a renewal fee 
(Rule 13(3) UPR and Art. 2(1), item 2, RFeesUPP) will be calculated on the basis of the reduced 
renewal fee.

6.5.2.
Withdrawal

A statement on licences of right can be withdrawn at any time by filing a request with the UPP
Division. The withdrawal will take effect only if the full amount by which the renewal fees were 
reduced is repaid to the EPO (Rule 12(2) UPR). The withdrawal request can be filed using EPO Form 
7002 or as a free-text letter.

6.5.3.
Deficiencies

If the statement or the request for withdrawal of the statement on licences of right submitted contains 
any deficiencies, the UPP Division will request of the proprietor to remedy these deficiencies within 
a period to be specified. Failure to rectify the deficiencies within the time limit set will result in the 
rejection of the request.

6.6.
Licensing commitments

The EPO has been entrusted with receiving licensing commitments undertaken by the proprietor of 
the Unitary Patent in international standardisation bodies (Art. 9(1)(c) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012
and Rule 16(1)(k) UPR). This commitment can be filed using EPO Form 7005 or as a free -text 
request letter. Such registration is free of charge.

6.7.
Changes of inventor data in the Register for unitary patent protection

A request to change the inventor data or the order in which the inventors are listed can be considered
as long as the Unitary Patent is still in force. The country and place of residence can be updated but 
any street name is deleted for those inventors for whom the change is requested.

Proceedings before the UPP Division

7.1.
Filing requirements

7.1.1.
Filing the request for unitary effect

For information on how to file the request for unitary effect, see 2.3.1.

7.1.2.
Filing of subsequent documents

After a request for unitary effect has been filed, any further documents needed for the procedure to 
obtain a Unitary Patent or relating to Unitary Patents already registered may be filed with the EPO, 
preferably electronically by means of EPO Online Filing, Online Filing 2.0, the EPO Contingency 
Upload Service or, for certain procedural actions, MyEPO Portfolio. Alternatively, they may be filed 
by delivery by hand or by postal services. Documents may not be filed by fax (see the decision of 
the President of the EPO dated 22 April 2024 OJ EPO 2024, A41 and the notice from the EPO dated 
22 April 2024, OJ EPO 2024, A42). For more details, see also EPC Guidelines, A-VIII, 2.5.

The EPO has a form available for use as a letter accompanying subsequently filed documents 
(EPO Form 7038).

Submissions filed electronically or on paper must be signed by an authorised person. If the document
is not validly signed, the UPP Division will invite the party concerned to sign it within a time limit to 
be specified by the EPO. If duly signed in time, the document retains its original date of receipt. 
Otherwise, it is deemed not received (Rule 50(3) EPC, Rule 20(2)(c) UPR).).

For documents or submissions filed electronically, an automatically generated electronic 
acknowledgement of receipt is issued. No acknowledgement of receipt is issued for documents 
subsequently filed on paper.

For the filing requirements for authorisations, see 7.2.5.

7.2.
Representation before the EPO

The EPC applies to representation in Unitary Patent proceedings (Arts. 133 and 134(1), (5) and (8) 
EPC, Rules 151 to 153 EPC, which apply mutatis mutandis pursuant to Rule 20(2)(l) UPR); see EPC 
Guidelines, A-VIII, 1).

7.2.1.
Appointment of a representative

The appointment of a representative must be made separately for proceedings relating to the Unitary 
Patent, even if a representative is already appointed for the EPC proceedings.

It is permitted to appoint a different representative for proceedings relating to the Unitary Patent from 
the one appointed for proceedings under the EPC. This different representative will be entered in the 
Register for unitary patent protection (see 7.6.1) and receive communications in respect of 
proceedings relating to the Unitary Patent, while the representative appointed for EPC proceedings 
will remain registered in the European Patent Register section on such proceedings and continue to 
receive communications relating to them.


Unitary Patent Guidelines

7.2.2.
Representation by a professional representative, list of professional 
representatives, associations, legal practitioner

Patent proprietors who do not have their residence or principal place of business in an EPC 
contracting state must appoint a representative and act through them in all EPO proceedings 
concerning their Unitary Patent, including the procedural act of requesting unitary effect (see 2.2.2). 
However, compulsory representation does not apply to the payment of fees (Art. 6 RFeesUPP).

Representation before the EPO in Unitary Patent proceedings may be undertaken by:

−
professional representatives or an association of professional representatives (see EPC 
Guidelines, A-VIII, 1.2) or

−
legal practitioners entitled to act as representatives under Rule 20(1) UPR in conjunction 
with Art. 134(8) EPC (see EPC Guidelines, A-VIII, 1.3)

7.2.3.
Representation by an employee

Proprietors having their residence or principal place of business in an EPC contracting state are not 
obliged to be represented by a professional representative or legal practitioner in EPO proceedings 
concerning their Unitary Patent. They may, irrespective of whether they are legal or natural persons, 
act through an employee, who need not be a professional representative or legal practitioner but 
who must always file an authorisation (see 7.2.5; see EPC Guidelines, A-VIII, 1.4).

7.2.4.
Common representative

If one of the proprietors is obliged to appoint a representative (see 7.2.2), that representative will be 
deemed to be the common representative acting on behalf of all parties unless the proprietor first 
named in the request has already appointed a representative (see 2.2.2; see EPC Guidelines, A-VIII, 
1.5).

7.2.5.
Authorisations

Representatives acting before the EPO in Unitary Patent proceedings must, on request, file a signed 
authorisation within a period to be specified by the EPO. The time limit cannot be extended (see
7.5.1). If the authorisation is not filed in time, any procedural steps taken by the representative, 
including the procedural act of requesting unitary effect, will be deemed not taken (Rule 152(6) EPC,
which applies mutatis mutandis pursuant to Rule 20(2)(l) UPR).

Professional representatives and legal practitioners entitled to act as representatives under 
Rule 20(1) UPR in conjunction with Art. 134(8) EPC will be required to file a signed authorisation 
only in certain circumstances, in particular if there is a change of representative or if there is any 
doubt as to the representative's entitlement to act (see the decision of the President of the EPO 
dated 8 July 2024, OJ EPO 2024, A76, and the notice from the EPO dated 8 July 2024, OJ EPO 
2024, A77). Therefore, if an authorisation is required under that decision, it needs to cover 
proceedings relating to the Unitary Patent.

Representatives may be authorised either by an individual authorisation or by a general 
authorisation. An authorisation given for European patent proceedings does not extend to Unitary 
Patent proceedings unless this is indicated by selecting the corresponding box on EPO Form 1003
(individual authorisation) or EPO Form 1004 (general authorisation) (see EPC Guidelines, A-VIII,
1.7). Alternatively, EPO Forms 7003 and 7004, which provide, respectively, for an individual and a 
general authorisation with respect only to Unitary Patent proceedings, can be used. When filing the 


Unitary Patent Guidelines 
Draft
April 2025

32

request for unitary effect (EPO Form 7000, see 2.2), it is possible simply to refer to a previously filed 
authorisation if it also covers Unitary Patent proceedings.

If one of the proprietors is obliged to appoint a professional representative, that representative will 
be deemed to be the common representative (see 7.2.4) unless the proprietor first named in the 
request has already appointed a professional representative. In that case, the authorisation does not 
need to be signed by all proprietors.

Authorisations may be filed electronically via EPO Online Filing, Online Filing 2.0 and the EPO 
Contingency Upload Service or on paper (see EPC Guidelines, A-VIII, 2.5). Authorisations may bear 
handwritten, facsimile or text-string signatures (see EPC Guidelines, A-VIII, 3.3), or digital signatures 
under the conditions specified by the decision of the President dated 8 July 2024 (OJ EPO 2024, 
A76) and the notice from the EPO dated 8 July 2024 (OJ EPO 2024, A77). Where a digital signature 
is used, the authorisation must be filed electronically. 

7.2.6.
Change of representation

Where possible, the UPP Division will take due consideration of cases where the EPO receives a 
request for a change of representation after the mention of the grant is published and before the 
unitary effect is registered. For changes after the registration of the unitary effect, see 7.6.3.

Where a representative resigns or a proprietor withdraws their representative's authorisation to act 
on their behalf, the subsequent procedure depends on whether the proprietor has their residence or 
principal place of business in an EPC contracting state.

If the proprietor has their residence or principal place of business in an EPC contracting state, the 
EPO will communicate directly with them in the absence of a new appointment.

Where the proprietor does not have their residence or principal place of business in an EPC 
contracting state and no (new) representative is appointed, the EPO will confirm this to the proprietor 
and, if applicable, invite them to appoint a representative. Where there are multiple proprietors, the 
invitation is sent to all of them. If the proprietors do not comply with that invitation, they cannot take 
any procedural steps until the deficiency is remedied.

Representatives can notify the EPO via MyEPO Portfolio of representation changes or their 
withdrawal from representation in respect of one or more Unitary Patents for which they were 
appointed (see the decision of the President of the EPO dated 9 February 2024, OJ EPO 2024, A20).

7.3.
Signature of documents

7.3.1.
Signature of the request for unitary effect

The request for unitary effect must be duly signed. It may be signed by the proprietor, provided that 
their residence or principal place of business is in an EPC contracting state. Where the request is 
signed on behalf of a legal person, the signatory's position within that legal entity must also be 
indicated. The request may also be signed by the representative if one has been appointed (see
2.2.5).

If there is more than one proprietor, each proprietor or their appointed representative must sign the 
request for unitary effect and, where applicable, the appointment of the common representative. This 
also applies if one of the proprietors is deemed the common representative (see 2.2.5).

7.3.2.
Signature of other documents

With the exception of annexes, any document filed after the request for unitary effect must be duly 
signed. The signatory's name and position must be clear from the signature. If the signature is 
missing on a document, the UPP Division will invite the party concerned to correct the deficiency 
within a time limit to be specified by the EPO. If signed in due time, the document retains its original 
date of receipt; otherwise, it is deemed not to have been received (Rule 50(3) EPC, which applies 
mutatis mutandis pursuant to Rule 20(2) UPR).

EPO Form 7038 is available in EPO Online Filing and Online Filing 2.0 (see 7.1.2) and can be 
downloaded from the EPO website (epo.org) for use as the letter accompanying subsequently filed 
documents.

7.3.3.
Form of signature

If documents are filed electronically using EPO Online Filing, the signature may take the form of a 
facsimile signature, a text-string signature or an enhanced electronic signature. Where documents 
are filed using Online Filing 2.0 or the EPO Contingency Upload Service, the signature may take the 
form of a facsimile signature or a text-string signature. 

Submissions made in MyEPO Portfolio require a signature in the form of a text-string signature (see 
the decision of the president of the EPO dated 9 February 2024, OJ EPO 2024, A20). Currently, only 
those documents specified in the notice from the EPO dated 9 February 2024 (OJ EPO 2024, A21) 
or in another suitable form may be filed using this service.

Handwritten signatures are accepted if a document is filed on paper.

For more details about the types of signatures that are accepted, see EPC Guidelines, A-VIII, 3.3.

For signature requirements on authorisations, see 7.2.5.

For the signature requirements on assignment documents and licence contracts applicable to 
contracts and declarations filed with requests for registration of licences and other rights in Unitary 
Patent proceedings, see 6 and the decision of the President dated 9 February 2024 and the notice 
from the EPO of the same date (OJ EPO 2024, A17, A18 and A22).

7.4.
Languages

The official languages of the EPO are English, French and German (Art. 14(1) EPC, which applies 
mutatis mutandis pursuant to Rule 20(1) UPR). The term "language of the proceedings" is defined 
in Art. 14(3) EPC. Both provisions apply pursuant to Rule 20(1) UPR in Unitary Patent proceedings. 
However, while parties may use any of the EPO's official languages in written proceedings before 
the EPO, the request for unitary effect itself must be filed in the language of the proceedings 
(Art. 9(1)(g) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012 and Rule 6(2) UPR).

The EPC provisions that allow documents to be filed in an admissible non-EPO language do not 
apply in Unitary Patent proceedings (Art. 14(4) EPC; Rule 3(1), second sentence, EPC; Rule 6(2)

EPC; see EPC Guidelines, A-VII, 3.2). Therefore, a Unitary Patent proprietor may not, for example,
file a request for re-establishment of rights pursuant to Rule 22 UPR in an admissible non-EPO 
language and then file its translation within a month.

7.5.
Time limits

7.5.1.
Determination of time limits

Most EPC provisions governing the calculation of time limits, such as Art. 120 EPC, Rules 131,
133(1) and 134 EPC, apply mutatis mutandis to Unitary Patent proceedings (Rule 20(2)(g) UPR).

However, some periods differ from those provided for in the EPC. These were modified to keep the 
overall duration of the procedure for requesting unitary effect reasonably short, in line with Regulation 
(EU) No 1257/2012. In particular, Rule 20(4) UPR sets a minimum period of one month instead of 
two. Also, the UPR do not contain a provision equivalent to Rule 132(2), last sentence, EPC.

7.5.2.
Failure to observe a time limit

Where a time limit for filing the request for unitary effect is missed, see 2.4. For the legal remedies 
available if the time limit for filing the request for unitary effect is missed, see 2.6. 

Re-establishment of rights may be available, for example, where the non-observance of a time limit 
is the direct cause of either the lapse of the Unitary Patent under Rule 14(1)(b) UPR or a loss of any 
other right or means of redress. For details, see 4. 

Where a time limit is missed to rectify a deficiency in a request for registration of licences and other 
rights, the UPP Division will reject the request (see 6.4.3).

7.6.
Publications and file inspection

7.6.1.
Register for unitary patent protection

The EPO is responsible for the administration of the Register for unitary patent protection under 
Art. 9(1)(b) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012.

The Register for unitary patent protection can be consulted as an integral but special part of the 
European Patent Register kept by the EPO under Art. 127 EPC (Rule 15 UPR, EPC Guidelines, 
A-XI, 4).

7.6.2.
Content of the Register for unitary patent protection

The Register for unitary patent protection contains all the entries that are expressly but not 
exhaustively listed in Regulation (EU) No 1257/2012, in particular the fact that unitary effect has 
been registered and the date of that registration, as well as any limitation, licence, transfer, 
revocation or lapse of a European patent with unitary effect. It also contains the particulars referred 
to in Rule 16 UPR for European patents for which unitary effect is requested.

The Register for unitary patent protection can be accessed free of charge via the EPO website 
(epo.org). See also 7.6.6.

7.6.3.
Recording changes in the Register for unitary patent protection

Changes to proprietor or representative entries are recorded in the Register for unitary patent 
protection by the UPP Division if unitary effect has been registered. For changes of inventor data, 
see 6.7.

If the publication of the European patent is corrected, the change is visible in both the EP Register 
and the Register for unitary patent protection.

If the period to file an opposition (Art. 99 EPC) has expired, the change is recorded in the Register 
for unitary patent protection but not in the European Patent Register. If the period to file an opposition 
has not expired, the change is recorded in both the European Patent Register and the Register for 
unitary patent protection.

7.6.4.
European Patent Bulletin

The European Patent Bulletin referred to in Art. 129(a) EPC contains, in a special part, the particulars 
of Unitary Patents (Rule 17(1) UPR).

7.6.5.
Official Journal of the EPO

All provisions relating to Unitary Patents, for example notices, decisions and information of a general 
character, are published in the Official Journal of the EPO (Rule 17(2) UPR).

7.6.6.
File inspection and communication of information

The files relating to Unitary Patents are available for online inspection in the Register for unitary 
patent protection, which can be found in the UP All documents panel view in the European Patent 
Register's dedicated Unitary Patent section.

On request, the EPO will issue certified copies of documents from the files of Unitary Patents (e.g. 
an extract from the Register for unitary patent protection), provided that the conditions for file 
inspection (Rule 20(1) UPR in conjunction Art. 128(1) to (4) EPC) are fulfilled and, where applicable,
an administrative fee has been paid. The request is free of charge if made using MyEPO Portfolio
(see EPC Guidelines, A-XI, 1 and OJ EPO 2024, A5).

In exceptional cases, and only if accompanied by a substantiated request, the EPO will issue 
uncertified copies of files or uncertified extracts from the Register for unitary patent protection. No 
fee is due for this service (see EPC Guidelines, A-XI, 2.2).

7.6.7.
Certificate and identifier for unitary patent protection

No additional documents are published in respect of a Unitary Patent. A certificate is sent to the 
Unitary Patent proprietor once unitary effect has been registered.

Unitary Patents are assigned a specific identifier ("C0") in the Register for unitary patent protection
(see 7.6.1), the European Patent Bulletin (see 7.6.2) and the data sets provided by the EPO, making 
them easy to identify in the EPO's patent information products and services such as Espacenet and 
the Global Patent Index. For further information, refer to the dedicated Unitary Patent page on the 
EPO website (epo.org).

7.7.
Legal remedies

7.7.1.
Actions against decisions of the UPP Division

Actions against decisions of the UPP Division may be brought before the UPC (Rule 23 UPR; 
Section 6 RoP UPC).

If the UPP Division rejects a request for unitary effect, an expedited action to reverse the decision 
may be lodged with the UPC's Registry (Rule 97 RoP UPC). This procedure does not include the
possibility of interlocutory revision by the EPO (Rule 85(2) RoP UPC).

More information can be found on the UPC website at unified-patent-court.org.

7.7.2.
Interlocutory revision

Interlocutory revision is only available where the UPC finds admissible an application to annul or 
alter a decision by the UPP Division (Rule 24 UPR; Rule 90(d) RoP UPC). Interlocutory revision is 
not available for an application to reverse a decision to reject a request for unitary effect (Rule 85(2)
RoP UPC).

If the UPP Division finds the application to annul or alter its decision to be well-founded, it will rectify 
the decision in accordance with the order or remedy sought by the claimant and inform the UPC of 
the rectification within two months of the date of receipt of the application (Rule 24 UPR; Rule 91 
RoP UPC).

If the UPP Division does not find the application to annul or alter its decision to be well-founded, the 
action will be pursued under Rule 92 RoP UPC.
