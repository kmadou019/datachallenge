Legal questions

Question 10

Hans filed an admissible notice of opposition against European patent EP-H. EP-H was 

validated in all EPC contracting states. EP-H validly claims priority from an earlier patent 

application. In the notice of opposition, Hans raised an objection of lack of inventive step of

claim 1 over the combination of two prior art documents, D1 and D2. While the opposition 

proceedings are pending, Theresa files third-party observations, arguing that claim 1 lacks 

novelty over D3, a German patent application filed before the priority date of EP-H and 

published after that date.

Claims analysis

Client’s application
(with claims as originally filed)

The present invention relates to a washing composition in the form of a tablet. The 

washing composition comprises:

(a)
One or more detergents (i.e. surface active agents), preferably in an amount of 10 to 

30% of the weight of the tablet. 

(b)
One or more builders, preferably in an amount of 20 to 60% of the weight of the 

tablet. Builders help to keep the water soft. Various builders and the properties 

described herein are known to the skilled person. Builders can be (i) phosphate-

based (i.e. they comprise phosphate salts) or (ii) phosphate salt-free (e.g. 

polycarbonate-based, silicate-based and so on). Phosphate salt-free builders are 

preferred. 

(c)
One or more bleaches, preferably in an amount of 10 to 30% of the weight of the 

tablet. Bleaches destroy coloured dirt components such as chocolate or red wine 

stains. 

(d)
Optionally a colourant, preferably in an amount of 1 to 5% of the weight of the tablet.

With regard to the tablet, preferably all detergents are contained in a first layer of the tablet

and all bleaches are contained in a second layer of the tablet. We have now discovered 

that the pressure typically used to prepare the tablet by way of compression leads to the 

degradation of one or more bleaches, whenever the detergents and one or more bleaches 

are mixed together. The advantage of having all detergents and all bleaches in separate 

layers is to preserve the bleaches, both during compression and during storage. Preferably

a third layer is placed between the first and the second layer. The third layer preferably 

comprises only a builder.

2019/P/EN/12

Claims analysis

Document D1 

D1 discloses tablets usable in washing machines and dishwashers. The tablets include, as

usual, a detergent, a builder, and a bleach. In a first embodiment, all ingredients are mixed

together and compressed to form a tablet. In a second embodiment, the tablet is rendered 

optically more attractive to the consumer. According to the second embodiment, all 

ingredients are mixed together and then the mixture is divided into two separate parts. To 

a first part of the blend, a colourant is added. The first part of the mixture forms the first 

layer of the tablet and the second part of the mixture (which does not comprise the 

colourant) forms the second layer of the tablet. 

Document D2

D2 discloses washing tablets comprising two or more layers. Bleaches, detergents, and 

colourants are usually produced by different manufacturers. It is suggested to produce a

Claims analysis

For questions 16 to 20, consider that the following description and Fig. 1 are the ones 

originally filed.

Description of the invention

[001] The present patent application relates to a composite structure such as an aircraft 

wing cover. Usually, such composite structures are mechanically fastened, for instance by 

bolts, to other workpieces. The bolts pass through holes in the composite structure.

[002] The problem is to strengthen the holes. 

[003] The solution is to employ reinforcing inserts for the holes in the composite structure. 

An embodiment provides a composite structure comprising a stack of plies of fibre-

reinforced composite material, one or more reinforcing inserts and one or more holes. The 

holes pass through the reinforcing inserts.

[004] Preferably, a support layer is joined to each reinforcing insert. The support layer is 

formed from a different material to the plies of composite material. The support layer 

carries the reinforcing inserts during the assembly of the composite structure, and 

improves the fastening strength.

[005] The composite fibres are preferably carbon fibres, while the support layer is made of 

metal such as aluminium. 

[006] Fig. 1 shows a composite structure 1 comprising a stack 2 which has 10 to 100 plies 

of fibre-reinforced composite material and a support layer such as a support grid 3. 

Cylindrical reinforcing inserts 4 are embedded in the stack 2 and bonded to the support 

grid 3. A hole 5 passes through each reinforcing insert 4. 

2019/P/EN/18


Claims analysis

[007] The mesh size is measured according to standard XYZ. The mesh size of the 

support grid 3 is between 0.5 and 1500, preferably between 100 and 150. It was 

discovered by chance that using a support grid 3 having a mesh size between 100 

and 150 improves the fastening strength considerably. This further improves the 

strengthening effect of the reinforcing inserts 4.

Claims analysis

For questions 19 and 20, consider that the following new set of claims (A.1 and A.2) has 

been filed by the applicant during the examination proceedings:

A.1
A composite structure comprising:

- a stack of plies of fibre-reinforced composite material, 

- one or more reinforcing inserts, and 

- one or more holes extending through the reinforcing inserts,

characterised in that it further comprises a support grid joined to the reinforcing 

inserts.

A.2
The composite structure according to claim A.1, wherein the support grid has a mesh

size between 100 and 150, measured according to standard XYZ.

Question 19 

For each of the statements 19.1 - 19.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false:

19.1
Claim A.1 is allowable under Article 123(2) EPC.

19.2
Claim A.2 is allowable under Article 123(2) EPC.

19.3
Claim A.1 is in a correct two-part form with respect to D12 as the closest prior art.

19.4
D12 can be considered to be the closest prior art because it addresses the 

strengthening of holes in a composite structure.

Claims analysis

Question 20 

For each of the statements 20.1 - 20.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false:

20.1
D11 does not teach the strengthening of plies of fibre-reinforced composite material 

using a support grid.

20.2
A valid argument as to why the skilled person would not arrive at claim A.1 if he 

combined D11 and D12 is that neither of the documents teaches a support grid 

joined to a reinforcing insert.

20.3
In view of the fact that the range as claimed in A.2 falls within the range as disclosed

in D11, the features of A.2 do not contribute to patentability over a combination of 

D11 and D12.

20.4
The features of claims A.1 and A.2 taken together are only a juxtaposition of 

features and do not have a combined technical effect.
