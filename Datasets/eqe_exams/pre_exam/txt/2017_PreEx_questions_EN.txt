Claim analysis 

2017/P/EN/12 

Description of the Client's Patent Application (Filed on 1 March 2014)  

 

[001] The present invention relates to toothbrushes for human use. Toothbrushes are 

used in combination with toothpaste by women, men and children for removing dental 

plaque from teeth.  

  

[002] Toothbrushes comprise bristles which are joined to a brush body. In known 

toothbrushes, the brush body comprises a brush head which holds the bristles, a handle 

held by the user during brushing of his teeth, and a neck between the handle and the 

bristles. In such known toothbrushes, the bristles are provided as a plurality of bristle 

bundles. The separate provision of the bristle bundles allows the bristles to be 

manufactured from a different material than the brush body. The bristle bundles are 

either joined to the brush head during the production of the brush body, or are joined to 

the brush head in a separate step after the brush body has been produced.  

  

[003] A drawback with these known toothbrushes is that the users need to be trained by 

dentists in order to achieve optimum dental plaque removal. If the users have not been 

trained properly, they are likely to achieve less than optimum results. The remaining 

dental plaque can give rise to dental caries, which is highly undesirable.  

  

[004] It is an object of the present invention to provide toothbrushes which overcome this 

drawback. This object is achieved by the subject-matter of the attached claims. In 

particular, the present invention is based on the surprising finding that the amount of 

dental plaque removal can be increased by transmitting additional vibrations to the 

bristles. These vibrations are generated by an electric vibrator inside the brush body. 

Preferably, the electrically operated vibrator is located in the handle together with a 

controller and a battery. In the present invention, the controller acts as a switching 

means for selectively supplying electric energy from the battery to an electrically 

operated element, because the controller connects and disconnects the vibrator from the 

battery. 

 


Claim analysis 

2017/P/EN/13 

[005] Brief description of the drawings:  

FIG. 1 shows the cross-section of a toothbrush 100 according to a first embodiment of 

the invention.  

FIG. 2 shows the cross-section of a toothbrush 200 according to a second embodiment 

of the invention. 

FIG. 3 shows the cross-section of a toothbrush 300 according to a third embodiment of 

the invention. 

FIG. 4 shows the cross-section of a toothbrush 400 according to a fourth embodiment of 

the invention.  

 

[006] The toothbrush 100 according to the first embodiment of FIG. 1 comprises a 

unitary brush body in which the brush head is fixedly connected to the handle. The 

unitary brush body comprises a bristle zone 110, a handle 130 and a neck 111 

therebetween. A plurality of bristle bundles 120 are held in the bristle zone 110. The 

handle 130 comprises a push button 132, a controller 133, a vibrator 134 and a 

battery 135. The controller 133 is connected with each of the push button 132, the 

vibrator 134 and the battery 135 by means of electric cables. As long as the 

controller 133 determines that the user's finger is pressing down the push button 132, 

electric energy is supplied from the battery 135 to the vibrator 134, and vibrations are 

generated and transmitted to the bristles.  


Claim analysis 

2017/P/EN/14 

[007] The vibrators of the invention are very energy efficient, and the batteries in the 

inventive toothbrushes will last much longer than the bristles. As a toothbrush with worn-

out bristles can hurt its user, the second embodiment of the invention allows the user to 

replace a worn-out brush head. The toothbrush 200 of FIG. 2 therefore comprises a 

body formed of a handle 230 and of a replaceable brush head with a bristle zone 210, 

bristle bundles 220 and a neck 211. The replaceable brush head comprises a 

connection hole 212 at the end of its neck 211. The connection hole 212 engages with a 

connection protrusion 231 on the handle 230, and thereby forms a connection section. 

The connection hole 212 and the connection protrusion 231 do not hinder the 

transmission of vibrations to the bristles. Once the bristle bundles 220 are worn out, the 

brush head can be pulled off the handle 230, and be replaced with a fresh brush head. 

Apart from the connection protrusion 231, the handle 230 also comprises a push 

button 232, a controller 233, a vibrator 234 and a battery 235. These elements function 

exactly like the corresponding elements in the first embodiment.  

 


Claim analysis 

2017/P/EN/15 

[008] Some users do not like pressing a push button while they brush their teeth. The 

third embodiment of the invention according to FIG. 3 therefore provides an alternative 

to a push button in the handle. The toothbrush 300 automatically detects that the users 

are brushing their teeth by means of a pressure sensor 313. The pressure sensor 313 is 

located in the bristle zone 310, for example below the bristle bundles 320. The pressure 

sensor 313 only generates an electric signal, when the user is pressing the bristles 

against his teeth. That signal is transmitted to the controller 333, for example by means 

of an electric cable embedded in the neck 311. As long as the controller 333 receives 

that signal, electric energy is supplied from the battery 335 to the vibrator 334. The 

brush head also comprises a connection hole 312 for receiving the connection 

protrusion 331 of the handle 330. Thereby, the vibrations can be transmitted to the 

bristles, and electric cables pass through the protrusion 331 and the hole 312 for 

establishing the electric connection between the pressure sensor 313 and the 

controller 333. Apart from the controller 333, the handle 330 also comprises the 

vibrator 334 and the battery 335. These elements function exactly like the corresponding 

elements in the other embodiments. Like in the second embodiment, a worn out brush 

head can be replaced by pulling it off the handle 330.  


Claim analysis 

2017/P/EN/16 

[009] According to market research, users think that a toothbrush has a higher cleaning 

efficiency if it looks technical. As the vibrator in the above toothbrushes is not visible, the 

technical character of these toothbrushes should be emphasised by including additional 

elements with a technical appearance such as a light-emitting diode (LED). In a fourth 

embodiment according to FIG. 4, the toothbrush 400 comprises a unitary brush body 

with a bristle zone 410, bristle bundles 420, a handle 430 and a neck 411 therebetween. 

In this embodiment, the handle 430 contains a LED 436, which is connected to a 

controller 433 by means of an electric cable. As long as the controller 433 determines 

that the user's finger is pressing down the push button 432, electric energy is supplied 

from the battery 435 to both the vibrator 434 and the LED 436. When users brush their 

teeth, the LED emits for example blue light while vibrations are generated by the 

vibrator 434 and transmitted to the bristles. Apart from the LED 436 and the 

controller 433, the handle 430 also comprises the vibrator 434 and the battery 435. The 

LED can also be incorporated into the first, the second or the third embodiments of the 

invention. The toothbrush 400 according to the fourth embodiment can also have a 

replaceable brush head and a connection section, similar to that of the toothbrushes 

according to the second and third embodiments.  

 

[010] The toothbrushes 100, 200, 300 and 400 according to the above embodiments 

must have a total length of less than 30 cm, and the toothbrushes with a replaceable 

brush head must have a total length of between 18 and 25 cm for ergonomic reasons.

You have found the following two documents D1 and D2 during a prior art search on the 

internet:  

 

Document D1 (published November 2013)  

  

[001] While cleaning their teeth, adults, in particular, often press their toothbrushes too 

hard while cleaning their teeth. This excessive force can seriously irritate the gums of 

these users. It is an object of the present invention to make a user aware of such 

excessive force.  

  

[002] The toothbrush of FIG. 1 comprises a bristle zone 11 with bristles 12, which is 

connected to a handle 13. The handle 13 comprises a controller 14, a battery 15, a 

green light-emitting diode (LED) 16 and a red LED 17. The brush head also contains a 

pressure sensor 18 in the bristle zone 11, right below the bristles. The controller 14 is 

connected with the battery 15, each of the LEDs 16 and 17, and the pressure sensor 18 

by means of electric cables. A pressure limit value, which has been obtained by clinical 

research, is stored in the controller 14.  

  

[003] The pressure sensor 18 generates an electric signal as long as the user presses 

the bristles against the teeth. That signal is transmitted to the controller 14, converted 

into a measured pressure and compared to the pressure limit value. As long as the 

measured pressure is below the pressure limit value, the controller 14 supplies electric 

energy to the green LED 16. The user is thereby informed that the brush does not harm 

the user's gums. However, if the measured pressure exceeds the pressure limit value, 

the controller 14 switches the energy supply to the red LED 17. The user is thereby 

alerted that the brush is pressed too hard.  

  

[004] The toothbrush according to FIG. 1 has a total length of 24 cm.

Document D2 (published October 2013)  

  

[001] Dentists recommend a minimum duration of two minutes for brushing teeth. 

Otherwise, too much dental plaque remains on the teeth and dental caries is likely to 

develop. In particular children tend not to brush their teeth long enough. Therefore, an 

improved toothbrush for children is needed. According to the following description the 

bodies of toothbrushes for children are generally made from thermoplastic materials 

such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyacrylics or polyamide. The bristles of these 

toothbrushes are made from polyethylene, polypropylene or polyamide. 

  

[002] The toothbrush of FIG. 1 comprises a replaceable brush head with a bristle 

zone 21 and bristles 22, a handle 23 with a controller 24 and a battery 25. The handle 

also includes a music module 26 with a loudspeaker, and a sensor 27. The controller 24 

is connected with the battery 25, the music module 26 and the sensor 27 by means of 

electric cables.  

  

[003] As long as a child holds the toothbrush in his hand, the sensor 27 is in contact with 

his skin and thereby generates an electric signal. That signal is transmitted to the 

controller 24, which then supplies electric energy to the music module 26 as long as the 

controller 24 receives that signal. As long as electric energy is supplied to the music 

module, it plays a melody over its loudspeaker, the vibrations of which are converted 

into vibrations of the air. The maximum duration of the melody is two minutes. Children 

want to listen to the entire melody, and therefore will be motivated to brush their teeth 

long enough.  

  

[004] The replaceable brush head comprises a connection hole, which cooperates with a 

connection protrusion on the handle. Once the bristles 22 are worn out, the brush head 

can be pulled off the handle 23, and be replaced with a fresh brush head. A toothbrush 

for children, such as the toothbrush according to FIG. 1, must have a total length of 13, 

14, 15 or 16 cm in order to allow small children to hold the brush.

The European Search Report established by the European Patent Office cites 

documents D3 and D4.  

 

 

Document D3 (published November 2013)  

 

[001] The present invention relates to toothbrushes for human adults. Toothbrushes are 

used in combination with toothpaste for removing dental plaque from teeth.  

  

[002] It is an object of the present invention to provide toothbrushes which prevent that 

dental plaque remains on the teeth. The present invention is based on the surprising 

finding that the amount of dental plaque removal can be increased by transmitting 

additional vibrations to the bristles of the toothbrush. These vibrations are generated by 

an electric vibrator in the toothbrush. The location of the vibrator directly below the 

bristles is required for optimum transmission of the vibrations to the bristles. 

  

[003] The toothbrush of FIG. 1 comprises a brush head with a bristle zone 31 and 

bristles 32, and a handle 33 with a controller 34, a battery 35 and a push button 36. An 

electric vibrator 37 is located in the bristle zone 31, right below the bristles. The 

controller 34 is connected with the battery 35, the push button 36 and the vibrator 37 by 

means of electric cables. Electric energy is supplied through an electric cable to the 

vibrator 37, as long as the controller 34 determines that the user's finger is pressing 

down the push button 36, and vibrations are generated and transmitted to the bristles. 

Thereby, the amount of dental plaque removal can be increased.  

  

[004] The toothbrush according to FIG. 1 has a total length of 24 cm.

Document D4 (published November 2013)  

 

[001] The teeth of dangerous zoo animals such as tigers and lions need to be cleaned 

on a regular basis by zoo keepers. Before dental cleaning can take place, these animals 

are mildly sedated in order to calm them down. It has been surprisingly discovered that 

vibrating toothbrushes keep zoo animals calm during dental cleaning. Thereby, the zoo 

keeper's risk of being hurt during dental cleaning of dangerous zoo animals is 

significantly reduced.  

 

[002] In a first embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the toothbrush comprises a handle 43 and a 

separate brush head with a bristle zone 41, bristles 42 and a neck. The brush head is 

connected to the handle 43 by means of a connection hole at the end of the brush head, 

which fits onto a connection protrusion on the handle 43. The brush head thereby 

becomes replaceable. Apart from the connection protrusion, the handle 43 comprises a 

controller 44, a battery 45 and a push button 46. The push button 46 allows the 

controller 44 to act as switching means for turning on/off a vibrator 47. The vibrator 47 is 

located inside the brush head, below the bristles 42. Respective electric cables pass 

through the connection protrusion and the connection hole for establishing the electric 

connection between the vibrator 47 and the controller 44. As long as the controller 44 

determines that the zoo keeper's finger is pressing down the push button 46, electric 

energy is supplied to the vibrator 47, and vibrations are generated and transmitted to the 

bristles. Thereby, the animal is calmed down, and safe dental cleaning becomes 

possible.  

 

[003] The minimum total length of the toothbrush is 40 cm in order to establish a safe 

distance between the animal and the zoo keeper. In order to further reduce the risk for 

the zoo keeper, brush heads with a much longer neck should be connected to the 

handle such that the animal keeper is placed further away from the dangerous animal 

during dental cleaning.  


Claim analysis 

2017/P/EN/29 

[004] Although this brush design is described for dental cleaning of animals, the 

minimum total length of 40 cm has the additional advantage that such a long brush can 

also be used for other purposes. In a second embodiment, the vibrator 47 is located in 

the handle of the brush, where the vibrations generated by the vibrator 47 are perceived 

as pleasant when the brush is used for scratching a human's back while taking a 

shower.

Question 16  

 

For each of the statements 16.1 - 16.4 indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false:  

  

16.1 Document D4 is useless for attacking novelty of claim II, because it relates to  

 dental cleaning of zoo animals.  

16.2  The additional feature "wherein the brush is designed for human use" in claim II.5 

 distinguishes the claim from document D4. 

16.3  The introduction of the disclaimer "wherein the brush is not for use on dangerous 

zoo animals such as tigers and lions” into claim II during substantive examination 

is allowable under Article 123(2) EPC. 

16.4 The subject-matter of claim II.2 is novel with respect to D4.

element" into claim II during substantive examination is allowable under  

Article 123(2) EPC. 

17.2  The introduction of the feature "wherein the body comprises a push button in the 

handle and a pressure sensor in the bristle zone" into claim II during substantive 

examination is allowable under Article 123(2) EPC. 

17.3  The introduction of the feature "wherein the brush is a toothbrush for human use" 

into claim II during substantive examination is allowable under  

Article 123(2) EPC. 

17.4  The introduction of the feature "wherein the electrically operated vibrator is 

located in the handle" into claim II during substantive examination constitutes an 

intermediate generalisation.

2017/P/EN/33 

For each of the statements 18.1 - 18.4 indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false:  

  

18.1  According to the client's patent application, a technical effect resulting from the 

feature "the connection section comprises a connection hole and a connection 

protrusion" of claim III may be identified as replacement of the brush head.  

18.2  With respect to D2 as potentially closest prior art and applying the problem-and-

solution approach, the objective technical problem underlying the feature "the 

electrically operated element is an electrically operated vibrator located in the 

handle" of claim III may be formulated as providing the possibility for easy 

replacement of the brush head.  

18.3  According to the client's patent application, a technical effect resulting from the 

feature "electrically operated vibrator" of claim III may be identified as transmitting 

additional vibrations to the bristles.  

18.4  The technical feature "the electrically operated element is an electrically operated 

vibrator located in the handle" distinguishes claim III from document D2.

Question 19  

 

For each of the statements 19.1 - 19.4 indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false:  

 

19.1 With respect to D3 as potentially closest prior art, the two-part form of claim III is 

correctly formulated. 

19.2  With respect to D3 as potentially closest prior art, the skilled person would 

consider a combination with D2 for providing a connection section comprising a 

connection hole and a connection protrusion between the neck and the handle of 

the toothbrush. 

19.3  D2 prompts the skilled person to locate the vibrator of D3 in the handle. 

19.4  A valid argument as to why the skilled person would combine D2 and D3 is that 

both documents relate to children's toothbrushes. 

 

 

 

 

Question 20  

  

For each of the statements 20.1 - 20.4 indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false:  

 

20.1 The two-part form of claim III is correctly formulated with respect to D4. 

20.2  Document D4 suggests to brush one’s teeth using a brush with an electrically 

operated vibrator in the handle. 

20.3  Document D4 is the closest prior art for the subject-matter of claim III. 

20.4  A combination of the first embodiment and the second embodiment of D4 renders 

the subject-matter of claim III obvious.
