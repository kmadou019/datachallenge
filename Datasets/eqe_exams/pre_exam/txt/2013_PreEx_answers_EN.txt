Examiner's report pre-examination 2013 
 
 
Preliminary remark: the references from the Guidelines are from the version of the 
Guidelines which was to be used in the present examination. 
 
 
Question 1 
 
The first application disclosing subject-matter X is EP-1, filed on 12 January 2012. 
The first application disclosing subject-matter Y is US-1 filed on 6 September 2012. 
US-1 is not the first application within the meaning of Article 87(4) EPC for subject-
matter X: consequently, it is not possible to validly claim priority from US-1 for 
subject-matter X. EP-2 was filed within the priority period of twelve months from the 
date of filing of both EP1 and US1, Article 87(1) EPC.  
 
If in EP-2 priority is claimed only from EP-1, the effective date of claim 1 is 
12 January 2012.  
If in EP-2 priority is claimed only from EP-1, the effective date of claim 2 is the date 
of filing of EP-2, 20 December 2012.  
If in EP-2 priority is claimed only from US-1, the effective date of claim 1 is the date 
of filing of EP-2, 20 December 2012: US-1 is not the first application.  
If in EP-2 priority is claimed only from US-1, the effective date of claim 2 is 
6 September 2012.   
 
1.1 - True 
1.2 - False 
1.3 - False 
1.4 - False 
 
 
Question 2 
 
The renewal fee for the coming year (the third year in the case of EP-Z) is due on 
the last day of the month containing the anniversary of the date of filing, i.e. 
30 April 2013, Article 86(1) EPC and Rule 51(1) EPC. The renewal fee with an 
additional fee may still be paid within six months of the due date, Rule 51(2) EPC. 
Further processing for paying a renewal fee is excluded by the provisions of 
Article 121(4) EPC and Rule 135(2) EPC. Renewal fees may not be validly paid 
more than three months before they fall due, Rule 51(1) EPC, second sentence. 
 
2.1 - True  
2.2 - True 
2.3 - False 
2.4 - False

Question 3 
 
Regarding EP-A, the period for paying the additional search fee is two months and 
the fees must be paid at the latest by 22 April 2013 [11 February 2013 + 10 days 
(=21 February 2013) + 2 months (=21 April 2013), extended to Monday 22 
April 2013], Rule 64(1) EPC, Rule 126(2) EPC, Rule 131(4) EPC and Rule 
134(1) EPC. 
Regarding PCT-B, the period for paying the additional fee is one month and the 
fees must be paid at the latest on 11 March 2013, Rule 40.1(ii) PCT and 
Rule 80.2 PCT. The PCT provisions do not have the so-called "10-day-rule". 
 
3.1 - True  
3.2 - False  
3.3 - False  
3.4 - True  
 
 
Question 4 
 
The priority period expires on 28 February 2013 [29 February 2012 + 12 months 
(=28 February 2013)], Article 87(1) EPC and Rule 131(4) EPC. The priority 
declaration must be made at the latest by 1 July 2013 [29 February 2012 + 
16 months (=29 June 2013), extended to Monday 1 July 2013], Rule 52(2) EPC, 
Rule 131(4) EPC and Rule 134(1) EPC. In order to validly claim priority, EP-II must 
be in respect of the same invention as EP-I, Article 87(1) EPC. According to the 
same provision, not only the applicant of EP-I can validly claim priority from EP-I: 
the successor in title as well as any person to whom the right to claim priority from 
EP-I was validly transferred can validly claim priority from EP-I.     
 
4.1 - False  
4.2 - True  
4.3 - True  
4.4 - False  
 
 
Question 5 
 
The European divisional application EP-D must be filed with the European Patent 
Office in Berlin, Munich or The Hague (Rule 36(2) EPC, third sentence, as entered 
into force on 1 April 2010). Irrespective of whether EP-P was filed in an official 
language of the EPO or in another language, the language of the proceedings of 
EP-P and EP-D has to be the same (Rule 36(2) EPC, first and second sentence, 
as entered into force on 1 April 2010). Renewal fees were already due for EP-P for 
at least the third and fourth year: these renewal fees are also due for EP-D, 
Rule 51(3) EPC. In view of decision G1/09, in the case where no appeal is filed, a 
European patent application which has been refused by a decision of an Examining 
division is still pending within the meaning of Rule 36(1) EPC during the period for 
filing a notice of appeal. Thus, it is not necessary to file an appeal to render the 
application pending so as to validly file a European divisional application. The 
twenty-four months time limit –triggered by the first communication under 
Article 94(3) EPC in respect of EP-P according to Rule 36(1)(a) EPC as entered 


 
 

 
- 3 -

into force on 26 October 2010– for filing a divisional application to EP-P is still 
running. 
 
5.1 - True  
5.2 - True  
5.3 - False  
5.4 - True  
 
 
Question 6 
 
The provisions of Article 14(2) EPC, second sentence, apply also to Euro-PCT 
applications in view of Article 153(2) EPC. The applicant of PCT-1 may bring the 
English translation into conformity with the application documents of the 
international application PCT-1 as originally filed.    
In this context it is irrelevant whether the correction is immediately evident from the 
English translation. Corrections cannot be derived from the priority document, 
Guidelines, H-VI, 4.2.1. (The provisions of Rule 56(3) EPC do not apply here.) 
 
6.1 - False  
6.2 - True  
6.3 - False  
6.4 - False 
 
 
Question 7 
 
To file an admissible opposition, it is not required to file copies of D1 and D2 
together with the notice of opposition, Rule 83 EPC (see also Guidelines D-IV 
1.2.2.1 (v), last two paragraphs). An opposition against patent EP-X could have 
been filed at the latest on 18 February 2012 [16 May 2012 + 9 months 
(=16 February 2013), extended to Monday, 18 February 2013], Article 99(1) EPC, 
Rule 131(4) EPC and Rule 134(1) EPC. The translation of the notice of opposition 
shall be filed within one month of filing the notice of opposition: therefore it was 
filed in time, Article 14(4) EPC and Rule 6(2) EPC. The Portuguese citizen resident 
in Portugal need not be represented in opposition proceedings, Article 133(2) EPC. 
 
7.1 - False  
7.2 - True   
7.3 - True  
7.4 - False

Question 8 
 
Amendments to PCT-Q must be based on the application documents as originally 
filed, Article 123(2) EPC: It is not allowable to add matter only present in the priority 
document (Guidelines, H-IV, 2.3.5), in the abstract (Article 85 EPC) or in a set of 
claim modified in the course of the proceedings.  
 
8.1 - False 
8.2 - False  
8.3 - False  
8.4 - True  
 
 
Question 9 
 
Lack of clarity is not a valid ground for opposition, Article 100 EPC. Everything 
made available to the public, for instance by use or by selling, before the date of 
filing of EP-G constitutes state of the art within the meaning of Article 54(2) EPC for 
EP-G. It is irrelevant who put product Z on the market. A possible way to have 
patent EP-G revoked is to oppose it for lack of novelty using product Z as prior art. 
 
9.1 - True  
9.2 - False  
9.3 - True  
9.4 - False  
 
 
Question 10 
 
The appealable decision is the written reasoned decision received on 
25 February 2013, Rule 111(2) EPC: the period of two months for filing an appeal 
is computed from the notification of the decision and not from the announcement of 
the decision at oral proceedings. Following the provisions of Article 108 EPC, the 
statement setting out the grounds of appeal or possibly amendments may be filed 
after the notice of appeal but within four months of the notification of the decision. 
The examining division shall rectify its decision if it finds the appeal to be 
admissible and well-founded, Article 109(1) EPC. If the board of appeal sets aside 
the decision of the examining division, reimbursement of appeal fees occurs only if 
it is equitable in view of a substantial procedural violation, Rule 103(1)a) EPC. 
 
10.1 - False  
10.2 - False  
10.3 - True  
10.4 - False  
 
 
Question 11 
 
The subject matter of claim I reads on to a stopper as shown in Figs. 1-3. 
The stopper of claim I is suitable for being inserted into the neck of a bottle to close 
the bottle: the subject-matter of claim I covers a stopper even when it is not in the 


 
 

 
- 5 -

neck of a bottle. The wording “when the stopper closes the bottle...” specifies the 
stopper when in use, but does not limit the stopper itself. 
The wording “the air channel extends through the whole body” includes partly 
extending air channels which are interconnected with each other so as to form at 
least an air channel extending through the whole body, as shown by the air 
channels 103 of D1. 
The third embodiment of the stopper of the application is covered by the scope of 
claim I, since the wording “the air channel extends through the whole body” does 
not exclude an interposed filter plate through which air can pass. 
The synthetic rubber is specified to be only an example for the material of the 
stopper, i.e. it does not limit the scope of claim I. 
 
11.1 - True 
11.2 - True 
11.3 - True 
11.4 - False 
 
 
Question 12 
 
The stopper of claim II is at least partly inserted into the neck of a bottle so that the 
bottle is plugged by the stopper; therefore, the subject-matter of claim II does not 
cover a stopper when it is not in the neck of a bottle. 
The stopper of the third embodiment of the application is described in 
paragraphs [010] and [011]. The stopper comprises a body and a filter plate. The 
straight air channel in the body does not exclude the presence of the filter plate 34 
either at the end of the body, as shown in Fig. 2 or within the body as shown in 
Fig. 3. Claim II relates to a stopper whenever it is inserted in the neck of a bottle. 
The last sentence of paragraph [010] describes the advantage of the stopper of the 
third embodiment which only applies when it is inserted into the bottle. Therefore, 
claim II covers the stopper of the third embodiment of the application.  
The randomly distributed, continuous network of interconnected air channels of D1 
cannot be regarded as a “straight air channel extending through the whole body”.  
The synthetic rubber is defined to be “more particularly” a material of the stopper, 
i.e. it does not limit the scope of claim II. 
 
12.1 - False 
12.2 - False 
12.3 - True 
12.4 - False 
 
 
Question 13 
 
The subject matter of claim III reads on to a stopper as shown in Fig. 1. 
The stopper of claim III is suitable for closing a bottle; therefore, the subject-matter 
of claim III covers a stopper even when it is not in the neck of a bottle (“being 
dimensioned..” is only a functional definition). 
The term “continuously” implies partly extending air channels which are 
interconnected with each other so as to form at least a continuous air channel 
extending through the whole body. 


 
 

 
- 6 -

The third embodiment of the stopper of the application is not covered by the scope 
of claim III, since the stopper is defined to consist (see Guidelines, F-IV 4.21) of a 
liquid-impermeable and air-impermeable rubber body which excludes the presence 
of the filter plate. 
No specific rubber is defined for the stopper, i.e. a synthetic rubber is not a feature 
defined in claim III. 
 
13.1 - True 
13.2 - True 
13.3 - False 
13.4 - False  
 
 
Question 14 
 
The subject matter of claim IV is novel over D1, since the body of D1 is made of 
cork and does not comprise rubber. 
The subject matter of claim IV lacks novelty over D2. The body of D2 comprises 
rubber tube 202b (paragraph [004]). The air channel is provided by the core of D2 
made of cork. When the stopper of D2 closes a bottle, air can pass between the 
interior and the exterior of the bottle, see paragraph [003]. 
The subject matter of claim IV is novel over D3, since as shown in Fig. 2 of D3 air 
can not pass through the hole 303 when the stopper of D3 is inserted in the bottle. 
D3 discloses a stopper comprising a body and an air channel extending through 
the body, since as shown in Fig. 1 of D3 air can pass through the hole 303 when 
the stopper of D3 is not inserted in the bottle. 
 
14.1 - True 
14.2 - False 
14.3 - True 
14.4 - True 
 
 
Question 15 
 
The subject matter of claim V.1 is limited to the second embodiment of the 
application shown in Fig. 2. 
The subject matter of claim V.1 is novel over any of D1 to D3, since none of these 
documents discloses a filtering unit. 
The filter plate 404 of D4 is a specific form of the more generalised filtering unit, i.e. 
the stopper of D4 has a filtering unit. 
 
15.1 - True 
15.2 - True  
15.3 - True 
15.4 - True

Question 16 
 
In the context of the problem-solution approach, the technical effect is based on the 
identified distinguishing feature of claim V.2 over D4 (Guidelines G-VII, 5.2). With a 
straight air channel extending from the first planar surface to the second planar 
surface, different rate of exchange of gasses by the stopper can be easily 
determined by varying the diameter of the straight air channel, see last sentences of 
paragraphs [006] and [008]. 
The blind-hole of D4 is formed together with the foam body, whereby the straight air 
channel is not necessarily quicker to manufacture. 
The gas permeability of the stopper is also dependent on the diameter of the air 
channel, and not only on the gas permeability of the filter plate (see 
paragraph [0008]). 
There is no basis for drawing any conclusion with regard to the amount of material 
used for making the stopper of claim V.2 or for making the stopper of D4.  
 
16.1 - False 
16.2 - True 
16.3 - False 
16.4 - False 
 
 
Question 17 
 
In the context of the problem-solution approach, the objective technical problem 
means the aim and task of modifying or adapting D4 to provide the technical effect 
that the distinguishing feature of claim V.3 provides over D4 (Guidelines G-VII, 5.2). 
The distinguishing feature over D4 (the air channel is a through-hole extending 
from the first planar surface to the second planar surface and that the filter unit is 
attached to cover an end of the through-hole) provides the technical effect that gas 
can pass only through the filter plate and the air channel. Hence, the rate of 
exchange of gasses through the stopper can be more precisely determined by the 
diameter of the air channel and the gas permeability of the filter plate. In view of 
this, a valid definition of the objective technical problem is how to make a stopper 
for a bottle having a predictable gas permeability (see paragraphs [0007] and 
[0008]). Another more general definition is how to make a stopper for a bottle that 
allows to better predict the maturation of the wine (paragraph [0003]), last 
sentence). 
Statement 17.2 is not related to the claimed distinguishing feature. For statement 
17.3 it is noted that D4 is already air permeable without using cork, i.e. permeability 
in general is not the problem to be solved. 
 
17.1 - True 
17.2 - False 
17.3 - False 
17.4 - True

Question 18 
 
The wording of A.V.4 extends beyond the content of the application as filed, since 
only synthetic rubber is disclosed in the application for all the embodiments. 
The wording of B.V.4 extends beyond the content of the application as filed, since 
none of the embodiments comprises more than one filter plate. 
The wording of C.V.4 does not extend beyond the content of the application as 
filed, since  this wording is explicitly disclosed for liquids (paragraph [0008]) and the 
stopper is for wine bottles (see paragraph [0001]) and wine as a specific liquid. 
The wording of D.V.4 extends beyond the content of the application as filed, since 
the body itself of the second embodiment shown in Fig. 2 has no micro 
perforations. The filter plate with the micro perforations is glued onto the body. 
 
18.1 - True 
18.2 - True 
18.3 - False 
18.4 - True 
 
 
Question 19 
 
The subject matter of claim VI. is limited to the third embodiment of the application 
shown in Fig. 3. 
The argument given in statement 19.1 is irrelevant for the stated problem. However, 
the statement 19.2 is valid as it demonstrates that D4 teaches a different solution 
and that D2 does not suggest any alternative to gluing as taught in D4. Statement 
19.3 is a valid argument, since the air channel of D3 is closed when the stopper is 
inserted in the bottle, so that a filter plate is of no use. Statement 19.4 is incorrect, 
since D4 already teaches the use of a plurality of air channels in the foam. 
 
19.1 - False 
19.2 - True 
19.3 - True 
19.4 - False 
 
 
Question 20 
 
The application does not explicitly disclose sparkling wine, which may have 
different constraints on the stopper and the bottle.  
The application only discloses the specific synthetic rubber; “rubber” includes also 
the undisclosed natural rubber. In the wording “such as rubber” a preferable 
undisclosed embodiment is unallowably introduced. 
The term “element” generalizes the form of the filter plate, which has no basis in 
the application. 
The deletion of the wording is allowable, since it is redundant with the direction of 
the flow of air already defined in the last three lines of claim VII. 
 
20.1 - False 
20.2 - False 
20.3 - False 
20.4 - True
