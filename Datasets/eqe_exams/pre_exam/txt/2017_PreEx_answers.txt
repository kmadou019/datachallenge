EXAMINER’S REPORT 

 

Preliminary remark: the references from the Guidelines are from the version of the 

Guidelines which was to be used in the present examination. 

 

 

 

Question 1 

 

EP-G was filed within 12 months from the filing of IT-G, Article 87(1) EPC. Only 

claims 1 and 3 of EP-G are directed to the same invention as IT-G (frame made of 

metal and frame made of aluminium), Article 87(1) EPC and G2/98. The withdrawal 

of the priority application IT-G has no effect on its validity, Article 87(3) EPC. IT-G is 

the first filing. The priority for claims 1 and 3 being valid, the effective date under 

Article 89 EPC for these two claims is the filing date of IT-G. Therefore, the 

catalogue is not prior art within the meaning of Article 54(2) EPC for claims 1 and 3. 

However, the effective date of the subject-matter of claims 2 and 4 is the date of 

filing of EP-G (frame made of steel and frame made of copper were not disclosed in 

IT-G), Article 89 EPC. Thus, the catalogue is prior art under Article 54(2) EPC for 

these two claims.  

 

1.1 – False 

1.2 – True 

1.3 – False 

1.4 – True 

 

 

Question 2 

 

The renewal fee in respect of the third year for Euro-PCT-J has fallen due earlier, on 

31 August 2016, Article 86(1) EPC and Rule 51(1) EPC. For PCT-J, one of the 

requirements for entry into the European phase today, 6 March 2017 is the payment 

of the renewal fee in respect of the third year, Rule 159(1)(g) EPC and Guidelines, 

A-X, 5.2.4. Also the designation fee is due today, since the period under 

Page 1 of 16


Rule 39 EPC has expired earlier (six months after the publication of the search 

report, i.e. in August 2016). Note that according to Article 153(6) EPC, the 

international search report takes the place of the European search report and the 

mention of its publication. The latest date for entering the European phase with EP-J 

is today, 6 March 2017 [4 August 2014 + 31 months (= 4 March 2017), extended to 

6 March 2017, Rule 159(1) EPC, Rule 131(4) EPC and Rule 134(1) EPC]. Today no 

further processing fee is (yet) due. The EPO shall carry out a supplementary 

European search, Article 153(7) EPC and Guidelines B-II 4.3.2 (ii) (see also OJ EPO 

2005, 422).  

 

2.1 – True 

2.2 – True 

2.3 – False 

2.4 – True 

 

 

Question 3 

 

Guidelines, A-IV, 1.1.1 is referred to: an application is not pending if it is deemed to 

be withdrawn due to the non-observance of a time limit, for instance failure to reply 

to a communication under Rule 71(3) EPC or failure to pay the renewal fee. 

Conversely, an application is pending if it was refused and if no appeal has yet been 

filed until the expiry of the time limit for filing the notice of appeal [28 December°2016 

+ 10 days (Rule 126(2) EPC) + 2 months (Rule 131(4) EPC) = 7 March 2017], see 

also G1/09. Thus EP3 is pending until 7 March 2017. For EP4, the decision to grant 

is issued before the publication of the mention of the grant. The decision to grant a 

European patent does not take effect until the date on which the grant is mentioned 

in the European Patent Bulletin, Article 97(3) EPC: thus EP4 is still pending today. 

 
3.1 – False 

3.2 – False 

3.3 – True 

3.4 – True

Question 4 

 

Adrienn is a natural person resident in Hungary: therefore, she is entitled to a 

reduction of the filing fee, Article 14(4) EPC and Rule 6(3)(b) EPC. One or more 

claims must be filed within two months of an invitation under Rule 58 EPC to correct 

the deficiency under Rule 57(c) EPC. A translation of the description must be filed 

within two month of filing of the European patent application, Rule 6(1) EPC. see 

also Guidelines, A-VIII, 1.1. The filing fee must be paid within one month of filing of 

EP-A, Rule 38(1) EPC. 

 

4.1 – True 

4.2 – False 

4.3 – True 

4.4 – False 

 

 

Question 5 

 

The statement setting out the grounds for the appeal must be filed at the latest on 

18 April 2017 [5 December 2016 + 10 days (Rule 126(2) EPC) + 4 months (Article 

108 EPC and Rule 131(4) EPC) = 15 April 2017, extended to 18 April 2017, Rule 

134(1) EPC]. The appeal fee is reimbursed, if the appeal is withdrawn before the 

filing of the statement of grounds of appeal (and before the period for filing that 

statement has expired), Rule 103(1)(b) EPC. If the appeal is not allowed within three 

months of receipt of the statement of grounds, it shall be remitted to the Board of 

Appeal, Article 109(2) EPC. Statement 5.4 is silent regarding inventive step of claim 

1 vs. D2. If interlocutory revision is to be granted, the applicant must address 

convincingly both grounds for refusal.  

 

5.1 – False 

5.2 – True 

5.3 – False 

5.4 – False 

Page 3 of 16


 
Question 6 
 

The notice of opposition against EP-V must be filed at the latest on 

20 February 2017 [18 May 2016 + 9 months (Article 99(1) EPC and Rule 131(4) 

EPC) = 18 February 2017, extended to 20 February 2017, Rule 134(1) EPC]. If the 

opposition fee is not paid within the 9 month opposition period, the opposition is not 

deemed to have been filed, Article 99(1) EPC, second sentence. The opponent 

cannot remedy a deficiency under Rule 76(2)(c) EPC, such as not mentioning 

sufficient facts and evidence. In such a case the opposition has to be rejected as 

inadmissible, see Rule 77(1) EPC, see also Guidelines, D-IV, 1.2.2.1 (v). However, the 

opponent can remedy a deficiency under Rule 76(2)(b) EPC, such as not mentioning 

the name of the patent proprietor, Rule 77(2) EPC, see also Guidelines, D-IV 1.2.2.2 

(ii). 

 

6.1 – True 

6.2 – True 

6.3 – False 

6.4 – True 

 

 

Question 7 

 

Rule 80 EPC only requires that amendments made in opposition proceedings must 

be occasioned by the grounds for opposition specified in Article 100 EPC. It is not a 

requirement of Rule 80 EPC that the amendments actually resolve issues raised in 

the notice of opposition. Although clarity is not a ground for opposition, in the present 

case the clarity of the amended claim can be discussed, since the amendment, 

which was introduced during opposition proceedings, is based on the description 

(G3/14). The patent proprietor is entitled to file amendments in reply to the 

communication informing him of the notice of opposition. Since the patent proprietor  

 
 

Page 4 of 16


requests to maintain the patent in amended form (in accordance to Article 101(3)(a) 

EPC), his request is not to reject the opposition (in accordance with Article 101(2) 

EPC). 

 

7.1 – False 

7.2 – False 

7.3 – True 

7.4 – False 

 
 

Question 8 

 

A communication by the EPO is deemed to be delivered on the tenth day following 

its posting (Rule 126(2) EPC). For the legal fiction of the deemed delivery, it is 

immaterial whether the tenth day falls on a Saturday or Sunday. The proceedings 

are interrupted with legal effect from the date of the occurrence of the event , in this 

case the legal incapacity of the representative, Rule 142(1)(c) EPC and Guidelines, 

E-VI, 1.3. The communication dated 7 September 2016 would be considered null 

and void and would be notified anew to the new representative only in a case where 

the communication was notified during an interruption period, Guidelines, E-VI, 1.4: 

this is not the case here. There is no provision in the EPC for paying fees for 

requesting interruption of the proceedings. 

 

8.1 – False 

8.2 – False 

8.3 – False 

8.4 – True 

 

 

Question 9  

 

The wording of the claim in statement 9.1 (in the so-called Swiss-type format) is 

directed to a further medical use of substance Z and can only be used for 

applications with a filing or priority date before 29 January 2011, see G2/08 and 

Page 5 of 16


Guidelines, G-VI, 7.1. The wording of the claim in statement 9.2 is correctly 

formulated as a further (so called “second”) medical use in accordance with Article 

54(5) EPC, see also Guidelines, G-VI, 7.1.2. The wording of the claim in statement 

9.3 is explicitly excluded by Article 53(c) EPC. The subject-matter of the claim in 

statement 9.4 is not novel with respect to the disclosure of the pre-published 

scientific paper, Article 54(4) EPC. 

 

9.1 – False 

9.2 – True 

9.3 – False 

9.4 – False 

 

 

Question 10 

 

According to Rule 54bis1.(a)(ii) PCT, in the present case of PCT-A, an international 

preliminary examination can be requested at any time prior to the expiration of 

22 months from the priority date. Therefore, on 30 November 2017 a valid demand 

can be filed. A handling fee is due for requesting the international preliminary 

examination, Rule 57.1 PCT. The applicant is entitled to communicate orally with the 

EPO as the International Preliminary Examination Authority, Article 34(2)(a) PCT. If 

amended claims for PCT-A are received by the International Bureau before the 

technical preparations for international publication have been completed, then the 

international publication of PCT-A will contain the full text of the claims both as filed 

and as amended, Rule 46.1 PCT and Rule 48.2(f) PCT. 

 

10.1 – True 

10.2 – True 

10.3 – True 

10.4 – True

Question 11  

  

11.1 True: The toothbrush of the first embodiment of the application is covered by 

the scope of claim I. Particularly, controller 133 is a switching means for selectively 

supplying electric energy from the battery to the electrically operated element. The 

controller connects the vibrator to the battery, and thereby controls vibrations 

generated by the vibrator 134 when the push button is pressed down by the user. 

Further, the brush body of the first embodiment is a (unitary) brush body in which 

the brush head is (fixedly) connected to the handle (see paragraphs [002] and 

[006]). 

  

11.2 True: The toothbrush of the second embodiment of the application is covered 

by the scope of claim I. Particularly, controller 233 functions in the same way as in 

the first embodiment. The feature “neck is connected to the handle” in claim I also 

covers a connection by means of a connection hole 212 and a connection 

protrusion 231. Further, the brush body of the second embodiment includes a 

handle and a replaceable brush head (see paragraphs [002] and [007]). 

 

11.3 True: The toothbrush of the third embodiment of the application is covered by 

the scope of claim I. Particularly, controller 333 is a switching means for selectively 

supplying electric energy from the battery to the electrically operated element. The 

controller connects the vibrator to the battery only as long as the user is pressing 

the bristles against the teeth and thereby generates a pressure signal. Further, the 

brush body of the third embodiment includes a handle and a replaceable brush 

head (see paragraphs [002] and [008]). 

  

11.4 True: The toothbrush of the fourth embodiment of the application is covered 

by the scope of claim I. The presence of an additional LED is not ruled out by the 

formulation "the body comprises...".  

 
 

Page 7 of 16


Question 12  

  

12.1 True: In particular, D1 discloses a switching means for selectively supplying 

electric energy from a battery to an electrically operated element since pressure 

sensor 18 in combination with controller 14 functions as a switching means. 

Excessive pressure will cause the controller to turn off the green LED and to turn 

on the red LED.  

  

12.2 False: D1 discloses a body for a toothbrush providing increased dental 

plaque removal. The toothbrush of D1 must be considered as being suitable for 

“increased dental plaque removal”, since toothbrushes are used for cleaning teeth, 

and for removing dental plaque (see paragraph [001] of D2). Further, the relative 

term “increased” does not seem to have any well-defined meaning in the art of 

toothbrushes, and therefore must be interpreted broadly. 

The body has a brush head with a bristle zone for holding bristle bundles, a handle 

and a neck between the bristle zone and the handle, and the neck is connected to 

the handle (see figure 1 of D1). 

The body comprises a battery (15), an electrically operated element (each of the 

two LEDs 16 and 17) and a switching means (14, 18) for selectively supplying 

electric energy from the battery to the electrically operated element. Pressure 

sensor 18 in combination with controller 14 is a switching means for selectively 

supplying electric energy from the battery to the electrically operated element, 

since it allows controller 14 to connect each of the LEDs to the battery, and 

excessive pressure will cause the controller to turn off the green LED and to turn 

on the red LED. In addition to that, D1 explicitly discloses "switching" in the 

statement "controller 14 switches the energy supply to red LED 17" (paragraph 

[003] of D1). 

 

12.3 False: The melody played in D2 shall have the effect that children brush their 

teeth for a longer period of time (see paragraph [001] of D2). A longer period of 

time automatically increases the plaque removal compared to brushing teeth for a 

shorter period of time. 

 

Page 8 of 16


12.4 False: D2 discloses a body for a toothbrush providing increased dental 

plaque removal. The toothbrush of D2 is suitable for “increased dental plaque 

removal” (see paragraph [001]). Further, the relative term “increased” does not 

seem to have any well-defined meaning in the art of toothbrushes, and therefore 

must be interpreted broadly. 

The body has a brush head with a bristle zone for holding bristle bundles, a handle 

and a neck between the bristle zone and the handle, and the neck is connected to 

the handle (see paragraph [002] and figure 1 of D2). 

The body comprises a battery (25), an electrically operated element (music 

module 26 with a loudspeaker) and a switching means (24, 27) for selectively 

supplying electric energy from the battery to the electrically operated element. 

Sensor 27 allows controller 24 to act as a switching means for selectively 

supplying electric energy from a battery to an electrically operated element, since 

controller 24 supplies electric energy to the music module 26 only as long as 

controller 24 receives the signal generated by sensor 27. Controller 24 thereby 

switches the music module ON/OFF (paragraph [002] and figure 1). 

  

   

Question 13  

  

13.1 True: The claimed range of from 18-25 cm in claim I.2 covers a toothbrush 

having a length of 24 cm.  

  

13.2 False: The specific disclosure of 24 cm in D1 is within the claimed range. 

 

13.3 False: The specific combination of (1) a length of 15 cm, (2) a body made 

from polypropylene, and (3) bristles made from polypropylene is not explicitly 

disclosed in D2. Such combination of features is a selection from three lists of a 

certain length, and must therefore be considered novel (Guidelines, G-VI, 8.i).  

  

13.4 True: The feature "brush head with a bristle zone for holding bristle bundles" 

does not require the presence of bristle bundles, since the bristle zone must only 

be suitable for holding them. Therefore, a body without bristle bundles is covered 

Page 9 of 16


by claim I, if the bristle zone of that body is suitable for receiving bristle bundles in 

a further manufacturing step after e.g. the injection moulding of the body.  

  

  

Question 14  

  

14.1 True: Neck 111 is connected to handle 130. The feature "connected to" is not 

limited to a connection section consisting of a connection hole and a connection 

protrusion, as in the second or third embodiments in FIGS 2 or 3. 

  

14.2 True: There is a connection section in FIG. 2, which consists of connection 

hole 212 and connection protrusion 231. That connection section connects the 

neck to the handle. 

 

14.3 True: The feature "switching means" is not restricted to a push button, since 

"for example a push button" is an optional feature. Controller 333 is a switching 

means for selectively supplying electric energy from the battery to the electrically 

operated element, since controller 333 meets the definition given in paragraph 

[004] of the application, i.e. it connects and disconnects vibrator 334 from battery 

335. 

 

14.4 False: There is no push button in the third embodiment according to FIG. 3, 

since the pressure sensor is described as an alternative to the push button 

(paragraph [008] of the application). 

  

 

Question 15  

  

15.1 False: The formulation "the body comprises..." in claim II.3 does not exclude 

the presence of further elements which are not mentioned in the claim. See 

Guidelines, F-IV, 4.21. Claim II.3 does not contain any disclaimer. Furthermore, 

the feature "switching means" is not restricted to a push button, since "for example 

a push button" is an optional feature. 

  

Page 10 of 16


15.2 False: Claim II.4 is a dependent claim, and therefore contains all the features 

of independent claim II. The electrically operated vibrator is claimed in claim II. 

Furthermore, claim II.4 does not contain any disclaimer. 

 

15.3 False: Claim II.4 is a dependent claim, and therefore contains all the features 

of claim II. The location of the vibrator is not specified in claim II. 

 

15.4 False: There is no indication in the application that electric cables cannot be 

present in the brush head. 

  

    

Question 16  

  

16.1 False: Claim II is not restricted to (tooth)brushes for humans. Claim II 

therefore does not exclude toothbrushes for zoo animals. In addition to that, claim 

II is not restricted to brushes with replaceable brush heads, nor mentions any 

length of the brush.   

  

16.2 False: A “brush designed for human use” is considered to be a brush suitable 

for human use. D4 – notwithstanding its suitability for human dental cleaning - 

explicitly discloses the "human use” of scratching one's back (paragraph [004] of 

D4).  

 

16.3 False: That would be an undisclosed disclaimer within the meaning of G1/03. 

Document D4 belongs to the state of the art under Article 54(2), and belongs to a 

neighbouring field. As D4 is potentially relevant for the assessment of inventive 

step, it may not be disclaimed by means of an undisclosed disclaimer. The criteria 

set out in G1/03 are therefore not met. 

  

16.4 False: All features of claim II.2 are present in D4. D4 discloses a brush with a 

body, wherein the body comprises a brush head with a bristle zone, bristle bundles 

held by the bristle zone, a handle and a neck between the bristle zone and the 

handle, wherein the neck is connected to the handle (see paragraph [002] and 

figure 1 of D4).  

Page 11 of 16


The body comprises a battery (45) and an electrically operated element (47), 

wherein the electrically operated element is an electrically operated vibrator (see 

paragraph [002] of D4), wherein the neck is connected to the handle by means of 

a connection section (paragraph [002] of D4). 

 

   

Question 17  

  

17.1 True: The statement is directed to claims filed with the client’s patent 

application. These claims may therefore serve as a basis for the amendment, even 

if there might not be a corresponding disclosure in the description. The feature is 

disclosed in dependent claim II.3, which was directly dependent on claim II. The 

original disclosure “switching means, for example a push button” in claim II.3 may 

be restricted to a push button, since claim II.3 must be construed in the sense that 

a push button is a switching means. Claim II.4, which also mentions a controller 

that is not recited in the proposed amendment, therefore does not have to serve 

as basis for the amendment. 

 

17.2  False: A pressure sensor in the bristle zone is disclosed in paragraph 008 as 

an alternative to a push button in the handle. The client's patent application does 

not contain any statement which would justify the combination of these features. 

 

17.3 True: This feature is disclosed in the general part of the description 

(paragraph 001). 

 

17.4 True: This statement does not ask whether the amendment constitutes an 

unallowable intermediate generalisation under Article 123(2) EPC. An electrically 

operated vibrator in the handle is disclosed in paragraph [004] or in any of FIG. 1 

to FIG. 4 only in combination with a controller in the handle and a battery in the 

handle. Claim II neither contains a feature directed to a controller, nor does it 

restrict the location of the battery to a battery in the handle. The amendment 

therefore is an intermediate generalisation, i.e. an amendment extracting a specific 

feature in isolation from an originally disclosed combination of features and using it 

to delimit claimed subject-matter, see Guidelines, H-V, 3.2.1). 

Page 12 of 16


Question 18  

 

18.1 True: The application mentions that the replaceability of the brush head is 

achieved by the provision of a connection hole at the end of the neck, which will 

engage with a connection protrusion on the handle (paragraph [007] of the 

application). 

 

18.2 False: The replaceability of the brush head is already achieved by the 

provision of a connection hole at the end of the brush head, which will engage with 

a connection protrusion on the handle (paragraph [007] of the application). Such a 

configuration is already disclosed in D2, which thereby at least implicitly relates to 

easy replacement of the brush head (paragraph [004] of D2). The objective 

technical problem, however, must be based on a feature which is not disclosed in 

the closest prior art.  

 

18.3 True: This effect is achieved by the presence of a vibrator in the toothbrush 

(paragraphs [004] and [006] of the application). 

 

18.4 False: Although there is a slight difference of the German language version 

compared to the French and English versions[*], paragraph [003] of D2 clearly 

discloses in all three languages that vibrations are generated via the loudspeaker. 

The melody is played over the loudspeaker of the music module, which is located 

in the handle. The loudspeaker converts the electrical signal so as to play a 

melody and generate vibrations in the air. Hence, the music module 26 and its 

loudspeaker is an electrically operated vibrator in the handle. 

[*] See D 0001/17. 

 

 
Question 19  

   

19.1 False: The disclosure of a length of 24 cm in D3 takes away novelty of the 

claimed range of from 18 to 25 cm. Said range should therefore be placed in the 

preamble. 

 

Page 13 of 16


19.2 True: The objective technical problem underlying the above feature may be 

regarded as allowing users to replace a worn brush head (paragraph [007] of the 

patent application). D2 discloses the combination of a connection hole and a 

connection protrusion as solution to that problem (paragraph [004] of D2). The fact 

that D2 is directed to children’s toothbrushes does not render D3 and D2 

incompatible. 

 

19.3 False: The vibrator of D2 serves a different purpose (paragraph [003] of D2: 

music) than that of D3 (paragraph [002] of D3: increasing the amount of dental 

plaque removed from the teeth). 

 

19.4 False: D3 relates to toothbrushes for adults (paragraph [001] of D3). 

 

 

Question 20  

  

20.1 False: D4 already discloses a first embodiment in which the connection 

section comprises a connection hole and a connection protrusion. In the second 

embodiment of D4, the electrically operated vibrator is already located in the 

handle.  

 

20.2 False: The second embodiment of D4, in which the vibrator is located in the 

handle, only suggests scratching one's back while taking a shower. 

 

20.3 False: The first embodiment of D4 discloses a minimum length of 40 cm, and 

hints at much longer brushes. The first embodiment of D4 therefore does not 

represent the most promising starting point, at least in view of the feature “length 

of the toothbrush is between 18 and 25 cm.”. The second embodiment of D4 only 

relates to scratching a human's back. That second embodiment therefore belongs 

to an entirely different technical field. Compared to D4, D2 or D3 are more 

promising starting points. 

 

Page 14 of 16


20.4 False: Even that combination does not disclose all the features of claim III, 

since none of the two embodiments of D4 discloses the feature “length of the 

toothbrush is between 18 and 25 cm”.
