Description of the application 

 

[001] The present invention relates to liquid soap dispensers. 

 

[002] Liquid soap dispensers which comprise a bottle wherein a pump is screwed onto 

the opening of the bottle are known. A dispenser containing liquid soap is shown in 

FIG. 1 of D1. The dispenser comprises a bottle with a threaded neck, a hand pump with 

a dispensing nozzle that screws onto the opening of the bottle, and a tube that extends 

from the hand pump into the bottle. The tube does not extend as far as the base of the 

bottle: the end of the tube does not contact the base of the bottle. The liquid soap used 

in D1 is an aqueous suspension. 

 

[003] A drawback of the liquid soap dispenser of D1 is that too much liquid soap is left at 

the base of the bottle that cannot be removed from the bottle, because the end of the 

tube does not contact the base of the bottle. 

 

[004] FIG. 1 shows a cross section of a liquid soap dispenser containing liquid soap 

according to a first embodiment of the invention. 

FIG. 2 shows a cross section of a liquid soap dispenser containing liquid soap according 

to a second embodiment of the invention. 

FIG. 3 shows a cross section of a liquid soap dispenser containing liquid soap according 

to a third embodiment of the invention. 

FIG. 4 shows a perspective view of a liquid soap dispenser according to the invention. 

FIG. 5 shows a perspective view of a refill liquid soap bottle according to the invention. 

 

[005] FIG. 1 shows a liquid soap dispenser 10 according to the first embodiment of the 

invention. The dispenser 10 comprises a bottle 11 and a hand pump 12 with a 

dispensing nozzle 13. The hand pump 12 is fixed onto the opening of the bottle 11. The 

base 11a of the bottle 11 is flat. A tube 14 extends from the hand pump 12 into the 

bottle 11 and is in contact with the flat base 11a of the bottle 11. An end part 14a of the 

tube 14 has an L-shaped profile so that the end part 14a of the tube 14 extends along 

the flat base 11a of the bottle 11.


Claim analysis 

2014/PE/EN 
 
Page 13 of 29 

[006] FIG. 2 shows a liquid soap dispenser 20 according to the second embodiment of 

the invention. The base 21a of a bottle 21 of the liquid soap dispenser 20 has a dome-

shaped profile. When a hand pump 22 is screwed onto the opening of the bottle 21, an 

end part 24a of a tube 24 is bent and guided by the dome-shaped base 21a towards the 

lowest part 21b of the bottle 21. Nearly all the soap can be removed from the bottle 21 

using this liquid soap dispenser 20; only a small amount of soap is left at the base of the 

bottle 21. 

 

[007] FIG. 3 shows a liquid soap dispenser 30 according to the third embodiment of the 

invention. The base 31a of a bottle 31 of the liquid soap dispenser 30 has a V-shaped 

profile. When a hand pump 32 is screwed onto the opening of the bottle 31, a tube 34 is 

bent by the V-shaped base 31a and an end part 34a of the tube 34 is guided towards 

the well 31b of the V-shaped base 31a. Because the well 31b has a very small volume 

nearly all the soap can be removed from the bottle 31 with this liquid soap dispenser 30. 

This dispenser is particularly suited for expensive liquid soaps. 

 

[008] FIG. 4 shows the exterior of a liquid soap dispenser according to our invention. It 

comprises a bottle 1 and a pump 2 with a nozzle 3. The pump 2 is fixed onto the 

opening of the bottle 1. Any conventional pump can be used. 

 

[009] As shown in FIG. 5, the bottles of the liquid soap dispensers of all the above 

described embodiments of the invention can also be closed by a screw cap 43. The user 

then replaces the screw cap 43 by one of the corresponding pump-nozzle-tube systems 

of a used liquid soap dispenser in accordance with one of the above embodiments. 

 

[010] In all the embodiments of the invention we use liquid soap compositions containing 

water, detergent and 20 to 25 percent by weight of glycerine based on the total weight of 

the liquid soap composition. For example, the detergent is a blend of palmitate and 

stearate soaps. Preferably, the composition does not include non-ionic detergents.

Document D1 

 

[001] It is convenient to wash hands with liquid soap. FIG. 1 shows a cross section of 

our liquid soap dispenser 100 containing liquid soap. It comprises a bottle 110 with a 

threaded neck and a hand pump 120 which screws onto the opening of the bottle 110. 

The hand pump 120 has a dispensing nozzle 130 and a tube 140 which extends towards 

the base of the bottle 110. In order to prevent the tube 140 from being obstructed by the 

base of the bottle 110, the length of the tube 140 is chosen so that it does not contact 

the base of the bottle 110. 

 

[002] As liquid soap we use an aqueous suspension comprising water, detergent and 

suspended abrasive particles.

Document D2 

 

[001] A problem with known liquid soap dispensers is that some of the product cannot be 

removed from the base of the bottle. We have developed a liquid soap dispenser 200 as 

shown in FIG. 1. The liquid soap dispenser 200 containing liquid soap comprises a 

bottle 210, a hand pump 220, a dispensing nozzle 230 and a tube 240. The tube 240 

extends down to the base of the bottle 210 such that the tube 240 is bent and the end of 

the tube 240 extends along the base of the bottle 210.

Document D3 

 

[001] We sell washing-up liquids in squeezable plastic bottles. FIG. 1 shows a bottle 310 

containing a liquid with a base having a dome-shaped profile. This dome-shaped profile 

of the bottle's base ensures a stable stand on a flat surface, even if the material the 

bottle 310 is made of is very thin. The opening of the bottle 310 has a screw cap with a 

nozzle 330. A tube 340 extends from the nozzle 330 inside the bottle 310. 

 

[002] To remove the liquid, the bottle 310 is turned upside down and squeezed. A user is 

able to control the amount of liquid squeezed out of the bottle 310. Since the neck of the 

bottle is very narrow, nearly all the liquid can be removed in this way. When the 

bottle 310 is almost empty it can be rinsed out with warm water to completely remove all 

liquid from the bottle. 

 

[003] The washing-up liquid comprises water, detergents and optionally perfumes and/or 

colourants.

[001] We manufacture liquid soap dispensing systems for wash basins. FIG. 1 shows a 

liquid soap dispensing system 400 which comprises a manually actuated pump 420 

which pumps liquid soap from a reservoir bottle 410. The pump 420 is positioned at the 

height of a wash basin 450 and the bottle 410 is placed below the pump 420 as shown 

in FIG. 1. A tube 430 connects the pump 420 with the bottle 410. As shown in FIG. 1 the 

tube 430 extends horizontally away from the pump and then vertically down into the 

bottle 410.

16.1 There is basis in the application as filed for amending claim III to exclude from the 

scope of said claim compositions including non-ionic detergents. 

16.2 It would be allowable under Article 123(2) EPC to replace the expression "water" 

in claim III by the expression "aqueous suspension". 

16.3 A claim reading: "Liquid soap composition consisting of water, detergent  

and 20 to 25 percent by weight of glycerine based on the total weight of the liquid 

soap composition." has a narrower scope than that of claim III. 

16.4 It would be allowable under Article 123(2) EPC to exclude from the scope of 

claim III compositions comprising 23 percent by weight of glycerine based on the 

total weight of the liquid soap composition, to render the subject-matter of claim III 

novel over a prior art document under Article 54(3) EPC disclosing a liquid soap 

composition comprising water, detergent and 23 percent by weight of glycerine 

based on the total weight of the liquid soap composition.

QUESTION 17 

 

For questions 17 to 20, assume that independent claim IV.1 and dependent claims IV.2, 

IV.3 and IV.4 were filed with the client's patent application: 

 

IV.1  A dispensing system comprising: 

 
(a) a hand pump; 

 
(b) a bottle for liquid soap; 

 
(c) a tube, 

 
characterised in that the bottle comprises a base which is in contact with a part of 

the tube. 

IV.2 
A dispensing system according to claim IV.1, wherein the base of the bottle is 

dome-shaped for guiding away the tube from the top of the dome. 

IV.3 
A dispensing system according to claim IV.1, wherein the tube has a right angled 

portion and an end of the tube is in contact with the base of the bottle. 

IV.4 
A dispensing system according to claim IV.1, wherein the base of the bottle has a 

V-shaped well that guides an end of the tube into the lowest part of the base of 

the bottle. 

 

For each of the statements 17.1 – 17.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

17.1 Claim IV.1 covers the dispensing system of the second embodiment of the 

application when the bottle contains hand cream instead of liquid soap. 

17.2 Claim IV.2 unambiguously defines that the tube ends in the lowest part of the 

bottle. 

17.3 Claim IV.2 covers the dispensing system of the second embodiment of the application. 

17.4 The scope of claim IV.3 is limited to an embodiment wherein the right angled 

portion of the tube is positioned inside the bottle.

QUESTION 18 

 

For each of the statements 18.1 – 18.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

With respect to D1 as the closest prior art, a technical effect, which is achieved by the 

features of the characterising portion of claim IV.1, is that  

18.1 ... the tube is flexible. 

18.2 ... the tube is longer than in the prior art. 

18.3 ... the tube cannot be straight. 

18.4 ... the amount of the product remaining at the base of the bottle is reduced. 

 

 

QUESTION 19 

 

For each of the statements 19.1 – 19.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

19.1 Since D1 discloses all of the features of the pre-characterising part of claim IV.1, 

D1 is the closest prior art for claim IV.1. 

19.2 Since the bottle of D2 does not have a dome-shaped base, D2 is not the closest 

prior art for claim IV.2. 

19.3 Since the bottle of D3 has a dome-shaped base, D3 is the closest prior art for 

claim IV.2. 

19.4 Since D4 discloses a tube that has a right angled portion, D4 is the closest prior 

art for claim IV.3.

QUESTION 20 

 

For question 20 assume that: 

(a) D2 is the closest prior art for claim IV.4; and 

(b) the distinguishing feature of claim IV.4 over D2 is that D2 does not disclose that the 

 
base of the bottle has a V-shaped well that guides the end of the tube into the well; 

 
and 

(c) 
the problem solution approach is used for assessing inventive step of claim IV.4. 

 

For each of the statements 20.1 – 20.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

Given (a), (b) and (c) ... 

20.1 ... the technical problem can be formulated as: how to reduce the amount of liquid 

soap remaining in the bottle. 

20.2 ... the technical effect of the distinguishing feature is that the remainder of the 

liquid soap collects in the well. 

20.3 ... the technical problem can be formulated as: how to ensure that all liquid soap 

is completely removed from the bottle. 

20.4 ... a valid argument as to why D3 cannot be combined with D2 is that D3 does not 

disclose expensive liquid soaps but only washing up liquids.
