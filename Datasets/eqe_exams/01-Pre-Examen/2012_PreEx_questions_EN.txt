1. 
The pre-examination is in the form of a multiple choice paper. It comprises 20 
questions in all, 10 questions relating to legal knowledge (questions 1-10) and 10 
questions relating to the analysis of claims (questions 11-20). Questions must be 
answered by filling in the circles on the answer sheet printed on the reverse side of your 
personal cover sheet. The duration of this examination is four hours. 
 
(a) 
Each question X has 4 separate statements, namely X.1, X.2, X.3 and X.4. For 
each statement X.1, X.2, X.3 and X.4 candidates must unambiguously indicate on the 
answer sheet whether the statement is true or false. For each statement X.1, X.2, X.3 
and X.4 only one answer can be given, either true or false. Each statement within a 
question is to be considered independently of the other statements.  
 
(b) 
To indicate that a statement X.1, X.2, X.3 or X.4 is true, the corresponding circle 
for true should be filled using a black medium soft HB pencil. To indicate that a 
statement X.1, X.2, X.3 or X.4 is false, the corresponding circle for false should be filled 
using a black medium soft HB pencil. 
 
(c) 
If, in reply to a statement X.1, X.2, X.3 or X.4, no indication is given as to whether 
the statement is true or false, or if both true and false are indicated, then the answer to 
this statement will be deemed not to be correct. Accordingly, if a candidate fills or partly 
fills a circle they do not intend to submit as part of their answer, it is essential that any 
mark in that circle is fully erased.  
 
(d) 
There is no possibility for submitting notes or remarks to the examiner. Any such 
submission will be disregarded.

QUESTION 4  

 

A PCT application was filed with the EPO. As the International Searching Authority, the 

EPO considered that the application was not unitary. The invention first mentioned in the 

claims was searched and an invitation to pay two additional international search fees 

was sent to the applicant last week. The third invention, which has not yet been 

searched, is the only invention that the applicant would like to pursue in the European 

phase before the EPO.  

 

For each of the statements 4.1 – 4.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

4.1 
In the international PCT phase, the applicant can file a protest with the EPO and 

request that a full search is made. The protest is free of charge, but it has to be 

supported by arguments.  

4.2 
The applicant can timely pay one additional fee for the third invention to be 

searched in the international PCT phase. In the European phase, the applicant 

can limit the application to the third invention.  

4.3 
The applicant can ignore the invitation. In the European phase, the applicant can 

file a divisional application directed to the third invention.  

4.4 
The applicant can ignore the invitation. In the European phase, the applicant will 

again receive an invitation to pay additional search fees.

QUESTION 5 

 

On 1 February 2010 Document US1 was published. US1 discloses inventive feature A 

but not feature B. On 1 June 2010 your client filed European patent application EP1 

disclosing inventive feature B but not feature A. On 1 June 2011 your client filed 

European patent application EP2 claiming priority from EP1. EP2 has the following 

claims: Claim 1 is directed to feature B; claim 2 is directed to the combination of 

features B and A. EP1 was published in December 2011. The combination of 

features B and A would be obvious if the skilled person were aware of the disclosures of 

EP1 and US1. 

 

For each of the statements 5.1 – 5.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

5.1 
The subject-matter of claim 2 of EP2 lacks inventive step.  

5.2 
If EP2 had not claimed priority from EP1, the patentability of claim 1 of EP2 would 

not change.  

5.3 
A valid novelty objection can be made using EP1 against claim 1 of EP2.  

5.4 
The subject-matter of claim 2 of EP2 is novel.

QUESTION 8 

 

The publication of the mention of the grant of a European patent was made on 

22 June 2011. The European patent includes independent claim 1 directed to a product 

and independent claim 2 directed to a process. The two claims are not linked by a single 

general inventive concept.  

Your client wants the opposition division to revoke the patent in its entirety but so far he 

has found state of the art that anticipates the subject-matter of product claim 1 only.

the opponent to claim 2 after the expiry of the opposition period.  

8.3 
The statement setting out the grounds for opposition must be filed at the latest by 

22 May 2012.  

8.4 
As claims 1 and 2 are not linked by a single general inventive concept, lack of 

unity of the invention is a valid ground for opposition.

QUESTION 9 

 

Your British client buys a French company with all its assets including an international 

application PCT1 directed to a first invention and a French application FR2 directed to a 

second invention. Both applications are in the French language. PCT1 was filed in 

December 2009 and FR2 was filed in April 2011. Neither application claims an earlier 

priority. Your client wants to pursue both inventions as European patent applications, by 

entering the European phase with PCT1 and by filing a European application EP-FR 

claiming the priority from FR2. However, he would prefer that the language of the 

European proceedings of both applications be English. 

 

For each of the statements 9.1 – 9.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

9.1 
Upon entry of PCT1 into the European phase before the EPO, your client can file 

a translation of PCT1 into English, and English will become the language of the 

proceedings. 

9.2 
A European patent application validly claiming priority from FR2 can be filed in 

English.  

9.3 
Today, on 5 March 2012, it is no longer possible to validly claim priority from FR2 

for a European patent application.  

9.4 
The applicant can file EP-FR in French and then validly file a European divisional 

application of EP-FR in English.

QUESTION 10 

 

The applicant did not respond to a communication issued by the examining division 

setting a two month time limit for bringing the description into conformity with the 

amended claims. The EPO issued a notice of loss of rights by registered mail dated 

23 November 2011. On Saturday 4 February 2012 the applicant discovered the notice of 

loss of rights in an unrelated file. 

 

For each of the statements 10.1 – 10.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

10.1 The time limit for requesting further processing expired on 3 February 2012.  

10.2 The time limit for requesting re-establishment of rights expires on 6 April 2012. 

10.3 For requesting further processing of a European patent application following 

failure to observe a time limit, the applicant must have taken all due care required 

by the circumstances to observe the time limit.  

10.4 To save the application, it is sufficient to timely:  

— file at the EPO a request for re-establishment of rights in respect of the time 

limit for requesting further processing;  

— pay the fees for re-establishment of rights and for further processing; and  

— demonstrate that all due care required by the circumstances to observe the 

time limit was taken.

Questions 11-20 relate to a European patent application filed by your client with the 

following description and drawings: 

 

Description of Client’s Patent Application 

 

[001] The invention relates to closures that are used to seal bottles.  

 

[002] D1 describes a prior art closure connected by thermal welding to a bottle.  

A projection is folded back on top of the main part of the closure. The projection forms a 

pull-tab for removing the closure from the bottle. The pull-tab can break away from the 

main part of the closure during mounting or removal of a screw cap so that the pull-tab is 

no longer available for removing the closure from the bottle.  

 

[003] The invention is defined in the claims. 

 

[004] FIGS. 1-3 illustrate a first embodiment of a closure 10 that covers an opening 42 of 

a bottle 40. The closure 10 includes a tab part 12 and a sealing part 20. A first portion of 

the tab part 12 is firmly attached to the sealing part 20. A second portion of the 

tab part is lightly attached to the sealing part (FIG. 2). The second portion of the 

tab part 12 can be released to form a pull-tab 18 (FIGS. 1 and 3). The pull-tab 18 can be 

gripped to remove the closure 10 from the bottle 40. FIG. 2 also shows a screw cap 46 

that is screwed onto the bottle 40 and covers the closure 10.  

 

[005] In the first embodiment, the sealing part 20 of the closure is formed from a 

laminated sheet comprising a polyester film 22 and a metal foil 24, for example an 

aluminium foil. The metal foil 24 seals the product in the bottle 40. The polyester film 22 

prevents the metal foil 24 from tearing as the closure 10 is removed from the bottle.


Claim analysis 

2012/PE/EN 
 
Page 13 of 36 

[006] A thermoweldable material 26 is provided on the lower surface of the 

polyester film 22. The thermoweldable material 26 is a material that softens on being 

heated and can be used to weld the closure 10 to the top of the bottle 40. The 

thermoweldable material 26 can be softened by heating (e. g. by inductively heating) the 

metal foil 24. 

 

[007] The tab part 12 is formed by a polyester film. The tab part 12 is attached to the 

metal foil 24 of the sealing part 20 (the upper surface of the sealing part 20) by an 

adhesive layer 32. The adhesive layer 32 includes a continuous adhesive portion 34, 

and a discontinuous adhesive portion which is preferably formed by two or more 

adhesive dots 36. 

 

[008] The continuous adhesive portion 34 completely covers a first portion of the upper 

surface of the sealing part 20 (forming up to half of the area), and permanently attaches 

the first portion of the tab part 12 to the sealing part 20. The discontinuous adhesive 

portion provides an incomplete layer of adhesive. Preferably the discontinuous adhesive 

portion is distributed over the remainder of the upper surface of the sealing part 20. 

 

[009] The size of the adhesive dots 36 determines the degree of adhesion of the second 

portion of the tab part 12 to the sealing part 20. The degree of adhesion is determined 

so as to prevent separation of the second portion of the tab part 12 from the 

sealing part 20 during attachment of the screw cap 46, but to enable a user to peel the 

second portion of the tab part 12 away from the sealing part 20 to form the pull-tab 18.  

 

[010] FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view illustrating the top of the bottle 40 with the 

closure 10 covering the opening 42 of the bottle and the screw cap 46 covering the 

closure 10.


Claim analysis 

2012/PE/EN 
 
Page 14 of 36 

[011] FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a method of opening the bottle 40. 

Firstly, the screw cap 46 is removed in the direction of the arrow 44. The pull-tab 18 is 

then peeled away from the sealing part 20. The pull-tab 18 is then pulled in the direction 

of the arrow 48 to cause the thermal weld of the sealing part 20 to the bottle 40 to break 

under the continuous adhesive portion 34. The pull-tab 18 is then pulled further in the 

direction of the arrow 48 until the closure 10 is removed from the bottle 40. 

 

[012] FIG. 4 illustrates a second embodiment of a closure 50 comprising a 

sealing part 20 configured to provide evidence of tampering on removing the closure by 

pulling the pull-tab 18. The sealing part 20 of the second embodiment only comprises 

the metal foil 24. The thermoweldable material 26 is provided on the lower surface of the 

metal foil 24 in the second embodiment. The second embodiment is otherwise 

constructed in the same manner as the first embodiment. The second embodiment of 

the closure functions and is removed in a manner similar to that of the first embodiment 

of the closure 10 illustrated in FIGS. 1-3. However, without the polyester film 22, the 

metal foil 24 tears as the closure 50 is removed from the bottle 40. A tear in the 

metal foil 24 therefore provides evidence of tampering in the second embodiment.

Document D1 

 

[001] FIG. 1 is a cross-section through part of a bottle 1 provided with a cap 4 that is 

screwed to a threaded portion 3 of the neck 2 of the bottle 1. The cap 4 can be 

unscrewed from the bottle to expose a closure 5. The closure 5 comprises a pull-tab 8 

that can be gripped to remove the closure 5 from the bottle 1 by pulling on the pull-tab 8. 

 

[002] As shown in FIGS. 1-2, the pull-tab 8 is folded back on top of a main part 6 of the 

closure 5. The main part 6 of the closure 5 is circular. The closure 5 is made from an 

aluminium foil with a thin layer of thermoweldable material 9 on a lower surface of the 

main part 6 of the closure 5. The main part 6 of the closure 5 is thermally welded to the 

top of the neck 2 of the bottle 1 by inductively heating the aluminium foil. 

 

[003] The pull-tab 8 is folded back on top of the main part 6 of the closure 5 as shown in 

FIG. 1 before the closure 5 is thermally welded to the top of the bottle 1 to avoid the  

pull-tab 8 being damaged by the threaded portion 3.  

 

[004] FIG 2. is a cross-section of the closure 5 showing the pull-tab 8 folded back on top 

of the main part 6 of the closure 5.  

 

[005] FIG 3. is a plan view of the closure 5 showing the circular main part 6 of the 

closure 5 with the pull-tab 8 projecting from the main part 6.

[003] The closure 1 includes a laminated sealing part 2 comprising a metal foil 3, for 

example an aluminium foil, and a plastics foil 4. A lower surface of the plastics foil 4 is 

coated with a thermoweldable material 5, which melts on heating, for example as a 

result of induction heating of the metal foil, to enable the closure to be attached to the 

neck of the bottle 11. 

 

[004] The closure 1 further includes a polyester film 6. Between the polyester film 6 and 

the metal foil 3 is a layer of adhesive 7. The layer of adhesive 7 extends over up to half 

of the closure 1 and firmly attaches that portion of the polyester film 6 to the 

sealing part 2. The remainder of the polyester film 6 is not attached to the sealing part 2 

and forms a pull-tab 9. The closure 1 thus includes a joined portion 8 where the 

polyester film 6 is attached to the sealing part 2, and a separated portion, forming the 

pull-tab 9, where the polyester film 6 is not attached to the sealing part 2.  

 

[005] As shown in FIG. 3, in order to open the bottle 11, the screw cap 10 is removed in 

the direction of the arrow 12. This reveals the closure 1 attached to the bottle 11. The 

closure 1 can then be removed by grasping the free-standing pull-tab 9 and pulling in the 

direction of the arrow 13. The joined portion 8 of the closure 1 can be pulled from the 

neck of the bottle 11, followed by detachment of the separated portion of the closure 1. 

The relative bond strength of the layer of adhesive 7 and that of the 

thermoweldable material 5 are such that the closure 1 is removable as a unit.

[006] FIG. 4 illustrates an alternative embodiment of a closure 21. The closure 21 is the 

same as the closure 1 except that an additional thin strip of adhesive 27 is provided to 

lightly attach the pull-tab 9 to the sealing part 2 to avoid damage to the pull-tab before it 

is used. The pull-tab 9 can be released by breaking the light attachment provided by the 

thin strip of adhesive 27. However, care is needed during manufacture to ensure that the 

attachment provided by the strip of adhesive 27 is not so strong that it prevents release 

of the pull-tab 9.
