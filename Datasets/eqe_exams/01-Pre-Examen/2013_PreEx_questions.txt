1. 
The pre-examination is in the form of a multiple choice paper. It comprises 20 
questions in all, 10 questions relating to legal knowledge (questions 1-10) and 10 
questions relating to the analysis of claims (questions 11-20). Questions must be 
answered by filling in the circles on the answer sheet printed on the reverse side of your 
personal cover sheet. The duration of this examination is four hours. 
 
a) 
Each question X has 4 separate statements, namely X.1, X.2, X.3 and X.4. For 
each statement X.1, X.2, X.3 and X.4 candidates must unambiguously indicate on the 
answer sheet whether the statement is true or false. For each statement X.1, X.2, X.3 
and X.4 only one answer can be given, either true or false. Each statement within a 
question is to be considered independently of the other statements.  
 
b) 
To indicate that a statement X.1, X.2, X.3 or X.4 is true, the corresponding circle 
for true should be filled using a black medium soft HB pencil. To indicate that a 
statement X.1, X.2, X.3 or X.4 is false, the corresponding circle for false should be filled 
using a black medium soft HB pencil. 
 
c) 
If, in reply to a statement X.1, X.2, X.3 or X.4, no indication is given as to whether 
the statement is true or false, or if both true and false are indicated, then the answer to 
this statement will be deemed not to be correct. Accordingly, if a candidate fills or partly 
fills a circle they do not intend to submit as part of their answer, it is essential that any 
mark in that circle is fully erased.

QUESTION 6 

 

In January 2009, the international application PCT-1 was filed in Japanese at the 

Japanese Patent Office. A translation of PCT-1 into English was provided upon entry 

into the European phase. In the examination phase before the EPO, the applicant notes 

that a term of the description was incorrectly translated into English. The applicant now 

requests the correction of this translation error. 

 

For each of the statements 6.1 – 6.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

6.1 
The correction can only be made if it is immediately evident from the English 

translation as filed upon entry into the European phase. 

6.2 
The correction can be made if it has a basis in the Japanese text as originally 

filed at the Japanese Patent Office. 

6.3 
A wrongly translated term in a European patent application can always be 

replaced by the correct term given in the priority document. 

6.4 
The correction cannot be made because PCT-1 was not filed in an official 

language of a Contracting State of the European Patent Organisation.

QUESTION 7 

 

The mention of the grant of a European patent EP-X was published on 16 May 2012. A 

Portuguese citizen resident in Portugal filed a notice of opposition by fax on 

15 February 2013 to the EPO, explaining why the subject-matter claimed in EP-X was 

not inventive in view of two published patents D1 and D2 explicitly identified in the fax. 

The fax was entirely written in Portuguese. The opposition fee was paid on the same 

day. Today, 25 February 2013, a letter from the Portuguese citizen that was sent three 

days ago reaches the EPO. Annexed to the letter is: 

(a) a complete translation in English of the fax sent on 15 February 2013, 

(b) copies of the two prior art documents D1 and D2. 

 

For each of the statements 7.1 – 7.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

7.1 
The opposition is not admissible, as the copies of the two prior art documents 

were filed after expiry of the opposition period. 

7.2 
The notice of opposition could have been filed at the latest on 18 February 2013. 

7.3 
The translation was filed within the prescribed time limit. 

7.4 
The opposition is not validly filed, as the Portuguese citizen should have 

appointed a professional representative for filing the opposition.

QUESTION 9 

 

The mention of the grant of European patent EP-G was published in July 2012. The 

patent proprietor of EP-G is Mr. G. EP-G was filed without claiming priority in 

January 2009. Your client, Mr. O, wants the patent to be revoked. He thinks that claim 1 

of EP-G is unclear. In fact, there are two possible interpretations of claim 1. Product Z, 

which has been on the market since November 2008, falls under one of the two 

interpretations. 

 

For each of the statements 9.1 – 9.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

A valid element of my advice to Mr. O is that ... 

9.1 
... lack of clarity is not a valid ground for opposition. 

9.2 
... if product Z was put on the market by Mr. G, product Z does not form part of 

the state of the art. 

9.3 
... EP-G should be opposed for lack of novelty, explaining in the notice of 

opposition why product Z anticipates the subject-matter of claim 1 of EP-G. 

9.4 
... product Z does not form part of the state of the art, as it is not a pre-published 

written document.

Description of Client’s Patent Application (Filed on 01.03.2010) 

 

[001] The present invention relates to stoppers for wine bottles. 

 

[002] Bottle stoppers for wine bottles comprising a body made of cork are known (see for 

example document D1). Cork is provided from layers of bark of cork oak trees. Cork is a 

material with a randomly distributed, continuous network of interconnected air channels 

running through the material. The material itself is impermeable to liquids and to gasses 

such as air. However, gasses can flow through the interconnected air channels. Thus, 

cork is impermeable to liquids, but permeable to gasses such as air. When a bottle 

stopper made of cork closes the neck of a bottle, gasses can flow through the 

interconnected air channels of the cork between the interior and the exterior of the 

bottle. An exchange of gasses between the interior of the bottle and the exterior of the 

bottle is necessary for the wine to mature. The optimal rate of exchange of gasses 

through the stopper differs from wine to wine. 

 

[003] A drawback with these known stoppers is that the gas permeability of the cork 

varies greatly depending on the tree from which it was sourced. It is therefore difficult to 

predict how quickly wine will mature in bottles closed with these stoppers. 

 

[004] It is an object of the present invention to provide bottle stoppers which overcome 

this drawback. This object is achieved by the subject-matter of the attached claims. 

 

[005] Brief description of the drawings: 

FIG. 1 shows a bottle stopper 10 according to a first embodiment of the invention, with 

one half cut away. 

FIG. 2 shows a bottle stopper 20 according to a second embodiment of the invention, 

with one half cut away. 

FIG. 3 shows a bottle stopper 30 according to a third embodiment of the invention, with 

one half cut away.


Claim analysis 

2013/PE/EN 
 
Page 13 of 33 

[006] The bottle stopper 10 of FIG. 1 comprises a body 2. The body 2 is made of 

synthetic rubber. The synthetic rubber is impermeable to liquid and gas. The bottle 

stopper 10 further comprises a narrow air channel 3, which extends through the body 2. 

When the stopper closes the neck of a bottle, gasses can flow through the air channel 

between the interior and the exterior of the bottle. Because the air channel 3 is very 

narrow, liquid cannot flow through it. The optimal rate of exchange of gasses for 

maturing a specific wine can be achieved by selecting a stopper 10 having an air 

channel 3 of an appropriate diameter. 

 

[007] The second embodiment of our invention enables the rate of exchange of gasses 

through a stopper to be more precisely determined. The bottle stopper 20 of FIG. 2 

comprises all the components of the bottle stopper 10 shown in FIG. 1. The bottle 

stopper 20 additionally comprises a filter plate 4. The filter plate 4 is attached to the 

body 2 with glue. 

 

[008] The filter plate 4 can for example be made of an aluminium foil with perforations 

forming micro air channels. The filter plate 4 has a predetermined permeability to gasses 

such as air but is impermeable to liquids. The filter plate 4 therefore prevents liquids 

from coming into contact with the air channel 3. The diameter of the air channel 3 and 

the gas permeability of the filter plate 4 determine the gas permeability of the stopper 20. 

 

[009] The filter plate may fall into the wine if it is pushed away from the body of the 

stopper by a corkscrew when opening the wine bottle. For this reason bottle stoppers of 

the second embodiment should be made longer than conventional bottle stoppers.


Claim analysis 

2013/PE/EN 
 
Page 14 of 33 

[010] The bottle stopper 30 of FIG. 3 comprises a body 2. The body 2 is made of 

synthetic rubber. The synthetic rubber is impermeable to all fluids, whereby the term 

fluids includes both liquids and gasses. The bottle stopper 30 further comprises a first air 

channel 3a, a second air channel 3b and a filter plate 34. The first air channel 3a 

extends from a first planar surface of the stopper 30 through the body 2. The second air 

channel 3b continues from the first air channel 3a and extends through the body 2 up to 

a second planar surface opposite to the first planar surface. The filter plate 34 is fixed 

within the body 2 so that gasses can flow between the first air channel 3a and the 

second air channel 3b through a part of the filter plate 34. Fixing the filter plate 34 within 

the body prevents the filter plate 34 from falling into the wine by the action of a 

corkscrew. 

 

[011] The filter plate 34 can be made of any metal foil with perforations forming micro air 

channels, thereby providing a predictable permeability to gasses such as air but being 

impermeable to liquids. Hence, the gas permeability of the stopper 30 is determined by 

selecting the diameter of the air channels 3a and 3b and by selecting a filter plate 34 

with a predetermined gas permeability.

Document D1 (Published June 2000) 

 

[001] FIG. 1 shows a stopper 100 for closing a bottle, with one half cut away. The 

stopper 100 is made of cork. Cork is provided from layers of bark of cork oak trees. Cork 

is a material with a randomly distributed, continuous network of interconnected air 

channels running through the material. The material itself is impermeable to liquids and 

to gasses such as air. However, gasses can flow through the interconnected air 

channels. Thus, a stopper made of cork is impermeable to liquids, but permeable to 

gasses such as air. 

 

[002] An exchange of gasses between the interior of the bottle and the exterior of the 

bottle is necessary for the wine to mature. When the bottle stopper 100 closes the neck 

of a bottle, gasses can flow between the interior and the exterior of the bottle via the 

air channels 103. The optimal rate of exchange of gasses through the cork differs from 

wine to wine.

Document D2 (Published April 2001) 

 

[001] This document describes a stopper for closing a bottle with an improved seal 

between the stopper and the neck of a bottle compared to stoppers made only from 

cork. 

 

[002] FIG. 1 shows a stopper 200, with one half cut away. The stopper 200 comprises a 

cylindrical core 202a made of cork and a cylindrical tube 202b made of synthetic rubber. 

The synthetic rubber is impermeable to liquids and gasses. 

 

[003] When the stopper 200 closes a bottle, the core 202a enables air to be exchanged 

between the interior and exterior of the bottle via a randomly distributed, continuous 

network of interconnected air channels running through the cork. The tube 202b ensures 

that the cork core 202a does not disintegrate when the stopper 200 is in contact with 

wine for a long time. 

 

[004] The stopper 200 is made by gluing a cylindrical core 202a made of cork into a 

cylindrical tube 202b made of synthetic rubber. A strong glue is used so that the 

core 202a does not detach from the tube 202b, even when the bottle is opened using a 

corkscrew.

Document D3 (Published April 2002) 

 

[001] This document describes a stopper for closing a bottle, which can be easily 

compressed when it is inserted into the neck of the bottle. This makes it easy to insert 

the stopper into the neck of the bottle. 

 

[002] FIG. 1 shows the stopper 300, with one half cut away. The stopper 300 comprises 

a cylindrical body 302 and a through-hole 303. The body 302 is made of natural or 

synthetic rubber. Rubber is a resilient material which is impermeable to liquids and 

gasses. Synthetic rubber is preferred, since it is less prone to deteriorate over time than 

natural rubber. Due to the through-hole the stopper can be easily compressed. 

 

[003] FIG. 2 shows, in cross section, the stopper 300 after it has been inserted into the 

neck of a bottle 305. The body 302 is compressed and the lower part of the through-hole 

is completely closed. The stopper is completely impermeable to liquids and gasses and 

tightly closes the bottle.

Document D4 (Published March 2002) 

 

[001] This document describes a stopper for closing a wine bottle. Exchange of gasses 

between the interior and exterior of a wine bottle is necessary for wine to mature. Red 

wine requires more gas to be exchanged than white wine. 

 

[002] The stopper comprises a body made of synthetic rubber. Synthetic rubber is a 

material which is impermeable to liquids and to gasses such as air. However, when 

synthetic rubber is produced as a foam, the synthetic rubber foam becomes gas 

permeable via a randomly distributed, continuous network of interconnected air channels 

running through the synthetic rubber foam. The rate at which gasses can flow through 

the synthetic rubber foam cannot be predicted due to the random distribution of the air 

channels. 

 

[003] FIG. 1 shows a stopper 400 with part cut away. It comprises a body 402 made of 

synthetic rubber foam and a filter plate 404. The filter plate 404 is glued onto a first 

planar surface of the body 402. The filter plate 404 is made of an aluminium foil with 

perforations forming micro air channels. The filter plate 404 prevents wine from coming 

into contact with the synthetic rubber foam. 

 

[004] When the stopper closes the neck of a bottle, the filter plate 404 is located inside 

the bottle. Gasses can flow between the inside and the outside of the bottle via the micro 

air channels in the filter plate 404 and the air channels in the body 402. 

 

[005] The stopper 400 comprises a blind hole 405 formed when producing the synthetic 

rubber foam. The blind hole 405 has an opening on a second planar surface of the 

stopper. The second planar surface is on the outside of the bottle when the stopper is 

inserted in a bottle. The hole 405 acts as a guide for inserting a corkscrew 406 into the 

stopper 400.

QUESTION 16 

 

For this question consider only claim V.2 of claim set V and assume that: 

a) the EPO examiner considers D4 to be the closest prior art; 

b) the EPO examiner identifies the straight air channel extending from the first planar 

 
surface to the second planar surface as the distinguishing feature with respect to D4. 

 

For each of the statements 16.1 – 16.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

Given a) and b), a valid identification of a technical effect for claim V.2 using the 

problem-solution approach is that ... 

16.1 ... a straight air channel extending from the first planar surface to the second 

planar surface is quicker to manufacture than foam. 

16.2 ... with a straight air channel extending from the first planar surface to the second 

planar surface it is easier to determine by its diameter the rate of exchange of 

gasses. 

16.3 ... with a straight air channel extending from the first planar surface to the second 

planar surface the rate of exchange of gasses is determined only by the gas 

permeability of the filter plate. 

16.4 ... the provision of a straight air channel extending from the first planar surface to 

the second planar surface saves material of the stopper.

QUESTION 17 

 

For this question consider only claim V.3 of claim set V and assume that: 

a) the EPO examiner considers D4 to be the closest prior art; 

b) the EPO examiner identifies as a distinguishing feature with respect to D4 the fact 

 
that the air channel is a through-hole extending from the first planar surface to the 

 
second planar surface and that the filter unit is attached to cover an end of the 

 
through-hole. 

 

For each of the statements 17.1 – 17.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

Given a) and b), a valid formulation of the objective technical problem for analysing 

claim V.3 using the problem-solution approach is ... 

17.1 ... how to make a stopper for a bottle having a predictable gas permeability. 

17.2 ... how to make a stopper for a bottle comprising a straight air channel. 

17.3 ... how to make an air permeable stopper without using cork. 

17.4 ... how to make a stopper for a bottle that allows to better predict the maturation 

of the wine.

QUESTION 19 

 

For question 19, assume that claim VI is a single independent claim filed with the client’s 

patent application. 

 

VI. 
Stopper (30) for inserting into the neck of a bottle to close the bottle, whereby: 

− the stopper (30) comprises a body (2) made of liquid-impermeable and air-

 
impermeable material, a filter plate (4), a first air channel (3a) and a second 

 
air channel (3b), 

− the filter plate (4) is fixed within the body (2) between the first and second 

 
air channels (3a, 3b), 

− the stopper (30) is arranged so that when the stopper (30) closes the bottle, air 

 
can pass between the inside and outside of the bottle via the second 

 
air channel (3b), the filter plate (4) and the first air channel (3a).


Claim analysis 

2013/PE/EN 
 
Page 30 of 33 

For this question also assume that: 

a) the closest prior art is D4; 

b) the objective technical problem is “to provide a stopper having a filter plate 

 
whereby the filter plate is securely held”. 

 

For each of the statements 19.1 – 19.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

Given a) and b), a valid argument as to why it is not obvious to solve the objective 

technical problem by the features of claim VI is that ... 

19.1 ... starting from D4, the person skilled in the art would not consider to combine it 

with the teaching of D1, since the stopper of D1 is made of cork instead of 

synthetic rubber as is the stopper of D4. 

19.2 ... starting from D4, and considering D2, which teaches to use a strong glue, the 

skilled person would glue the filter plate of D4 to the body of D4 using a strong 

glue but would not consider integrating the filter plate of D4 within the body of D4. 

19.3 ... starting from D4, the person skilled in the art would not consider to combine it 

with the teaching of D3, since D3 does not provide a filter plate. 

19.4 ... starting from D4 alone, the person skilled in the art would not consider to 

provide two air channels.

QUESTION 20 

 

Consider that the applicant suggests to file the following claim VII as an amended 

version of claim VI after filing of the application. The changes to claim VI are highlighted 

by underlining additional words and striking through words which are deleted. 

 

VII. Stopper (30) for inserting into the neck of a bottle containing sparkling wine to 

close the bottle, whereby: 

− the stopper (30) comprises a body (2) made of liquid-impermeable and air-

 
impermeable material such as rubber, a filter plate filter element (4), a 

 
first air channel (3a) and a second air channel (3b), 

− the filter plate filter element (4) is fixed within the body (2) between the first and 

 
second air channels (3a, 3b), 

− the stopper (30) is arranged so that when the stopper (30) closes the bottle, air 

 
can pass between the inside and outside of the bottle via the second 

 
air channel (3b), the filter plate filter element (4) and the first air channel (3a). 

 

For each of the statements 20.1 – 20.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

20.1 The added wording “containing sparkling wine” is allowable under 

Article 123(2) EPC. 

20.2 The added wording “such as rubber” is allowable under Article 123(2) EPC. 

20.3 The substituted wording “filter element” is allowable under Article 123(2) EPC. 

20.4 The deletion of the wording “between the first and second air channels (3a, 3b)” is 

allowable under Article 123(2) EPC.
