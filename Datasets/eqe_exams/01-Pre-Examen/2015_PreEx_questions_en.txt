Description of the application 

 

Fire protection door 

 

[0001] The invention relates to fire protection doors. 

 

[0002] Fire protection doors prevent fire from propagating between different parts of a 

building. A fire protection door must include a door leaf, a door frame and a door closer. 

The door leaf and the door frame cooperate to prevent hot gases from passing through 

the closed door during a minimum protection time. The door closer has to ensure that 

the fire protection door is closed in the case of a fire. The temperature of the side of the 

door facing away from the fire must not rise above prescribed maximum temperatures.  

 

[0003] Up to now, fire protection doors have only been produced by the metal industry. 

The known fire protection doors have door leaves made of a metal casing. The metal 

casing normally is made using metal sheets to form a box and a cover. The space inside 

the box is filled with a thermally insulating material. Such known metal door leaves have 

a thickness of 5 cm or more. 

 

[0004] This known construction of a fire protection door has several drawbacks. First of 

all, the appearance and the shape of the door are very limited due to the metal sheets 

forming the metal casing. Further, the metal casing provides a thermal bridge so that it is 

difficult to comply with the requirement that the temperature at the side of the door leaf 

facing away from the fire has to be kept low. Moreover, the known door leaves tend to 

bend in case of fire: the metal sheet on the fire side of the door leaf expands more than 

the metal sheet on the cooler side facing away from the fire. This bending may create a 

gap between the door frame and the door leaf and is the main reason for failure of fire 

protection doors. Hence, the known door leaves made of metal casings have to be 

stiffened, for example by additional internal frame structures within the metal casing. 

 


Claim analysis 

2015/PE/EN 
 
Page 13 of 33 

[0005] The object of the invention is to overcome these drawbacks. 

 

[0006] An aspect of the invention relates to a door leaf for a fire protection door wherein 

the door leaf has a plate made of solid wood. For example, the door leaf comprises a 

plate of solid oak wood. Solid wood is readily available and is resistant to bending. 

 

[0007] Although wood is flammable, surprisingly it has been shown that a thick plate of 

solid wood used as a door leaf is able to withstand a fire for some time. Further, wood is 

heat-insulating so that no further filling is necessary. Our fire protection doors are 

produced in the wood manufacturing industry that differs considerably both in 

manufacturing machines and manufacturing techniques from the metal industry.  

 

[0008] One important condition for using a solid wood plate for door leaves of fire 

protection doors is that the plate is thick enough. With regard to solid oak wood, the 

plate must have a thickness of at least 8 cm, otherwise the requirements for fire 

protection doors cannot be fulfilled and the plate will not be suitable for a fire protection 

door leaf. 

 

[0009] Solid wood contains mainly wood fibres that can store moisture. For 

manufacturing our fire protection door leaf, we preferably use wood that is watered for a 

sufficient time so that the wood fibres contain enough moisture. When the wooden plate 

is heated in case of a fire, this moisture is released and evaporates. The evaporation of 

the moisture provides a cooling effect. 

 

[0010] Preferred embodiments are explained in further details with reference to the 

drawings. 

 


Claim analysis 

2015/PE/EN 
 
Page 14 of 33 

[0011] Fig. 1 shows a sectional view through a fire protection door comprising a door 

leaf based on wood material. 

 

[0012] Fig. 2 shows a front view of a first embodiment of the fire protection door 

constructed as a pivoting door. 

 

[0013] Fig. 3 shows a second embodiment of the fire protection door constructed as a 

sliding door. 

 

[0014] First, the general construction of a door leaf 1 for a fire protection door 10 is 

explained with reference to Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1, a door leaf 1 for a fire protection 

door 10 has an inner core formed as a plate 2 of solid oak wood having a thickness D of 

at least 8 cm. Solid oak wood burns very slowly. When using any other type of solid 

wood, the thickness D must be at least 10 cm. 

 

[0015] Preferably, both major surfaces A and B of the plate 2 are at least partially 

covered by covering layers. By choosing appropriate coverings, the appearance of the 

door can be adapted to the building where it will be used. The plate 2 of wood can also 

be made in many different shapes by easy manufacturing steps known in the wood 

industry. Thus, for example, even very old buildings can be protected by fire protection 

doors imitating the appearance of ancient doors.  

 

[0016] Preferably, the plate 2 is at least partially covered by a metal layer 3, 4. More 

preferably, both major surfaces A, B of the plate 2 are fully covered by aluminium sheets 

as metal layers 3, 4. A full covering of the wooden plate 2 by metal layers 3, 4 protects 

the wooden plate from drying-out. Aluminium has a melting temperature of about 600°C. 

In a case of fire, the temperature of the door on the fire side exceeds this temperature 

and the aluminium layer melts. The melting of the covering metal layers 3, 4 helps to 

keep the temperature low at the side of the door leaf 1 facing away from the fire. 

 


Claim analysis 

2015/PE/EN 
 
Page 15 of 33 

[0017] When the door leaf 1 is used in a pivoting door hinged in pivotal manner to a door 

frame 8, the side edges of door leaf 1 are stepped, and a corresponding step 7 is 

provided in the door frame 8. In the closed position, the engagement between the 

stepped door leaf 1 and the stepped door frame 8 provides a kind of labyrinth seal 9 that 

hinders hot gases from passing the door. However, such a stepped door leaf 1 is not 

suited for sliding doors. Many different sizes and shapes of steps are possible, however 

the step in the door leaf 1 and the step 7 in the door frame 8 must fit to each other; 

hence, door leaf 1 and door frame 8 of the fire protection door 10 are specially adapted 

to each other. 

 

[0018] The first embodiment of the fire protection door 10 shown in Fig. 2 has a stepped 

door leaf 1a, a door frame 8 and a door closer 12. The door leaf 1a is connected via 

door hinges 13 to the door frame 8 so that it can pivot between a closed and an open 

position. The door closer 12 biases the door leaf 1a into the closed position. The door 

closer 12 has a mechanical spring 14 urging the door leaf 1a to the closed position via a 

lever element 15. 

 

[0019] Fig. 3 shows the second embodiment. The fire protection door is a sliding fire 

protection door 20 having a door leaf 1b and a door frame 21 wherein the door leaf 1b is 

slidably guided to slide in a direction 22 parallel to its major surfaces. Further, a door 

closer 23 is provided including a cable 24 and a weight 25. The cable 24 and the 

weight 25 are hidden within the door frame 21. Because the elements of the 

door closer 23 are hidden, the door closer 23 is protected from interference and a very 

safe functioning is ensured.

Document D1: Metal door leaf for fire protection door 

 

 [0001] The invention relates to door leaves for fire protection doors. Door leaves for fire 

protection doors must withstand fire for a sufficient time wherein the side facing away 

from the fire must not become too hot. 

 

[0002] The figure shows a sectional view through a metal door leaf 100 for a hinged fire 

protection door. Although different metal materials can be used for the door leaf, steel is 

preferred. Steel has a melting point above 1300°C so that it can withstand temperatures 

occurring during fire and maintains its stiffness even at higher temperatures. 

 

[0003] The door leaf 100 has a first metal sheet 103 formed like a box and a second 

metal sheet 104 formed as a cover, the two overlapping on the sides 106 of the 

door leaf 100. The inner space is filled with a calcium silicate plate 105. The calcium 

silicate plate 105 is made of a cardboard that contains calcium silicate. The cardboard 

comprises wood fibres distributed within the plate 105. The calcium silicate stores a lot 

of water. In case of a fire, the water is released and evaporates due to the heat energy 

causing the water to change from a liquid to a gas. Thus, due to the filling, the door leaf 

is cooled in case of fire. Further, the calcium silicate plate 105 is thermally insulating 

during normal use of the door leaf 100. In order to reduce the tendency to bend, a 

stiffening steel frame structure (not shown) must be provided in the inner space. 

Although the insertion of the frame structure is quite complicated it is necessary to 

ensure a sufficient stiffness of the door leaf 100 in case of fire.

Fire endangers art treasures in Bavarian Alps 

by Peter Murphy 

 

[0001] In the Alps between the lakes of Tegernsee and Schliersee there is a charming 

village with a Catholic church built in the 14th century. The entrance leads into a small 

room with several hundred burning candles. This room is separated from the main room 

that contains antique furniture and old masterpieces of art by a very nice heavy door 

(see figure). The door is made of a plate 201 made of a single piece of wood with a 

minimum thickness of 8 cm and a weight of more than a hundred kilograms. The door is 

supported by hinges 202 having metal bands 203 that cover a large area of the wood 

plate and that also give the door its remarkable appearance. The door hinges 202 are 

not only fixed to the wooden frame 204, but also to the stone wall surrounding the door 

opening. The door is provided with a rock 205 on a cable or a rope 206 for biasing the 

door to a closed position. 

 

[0002] Several years ago the candles in the small entrance room caused a fire that burnt 

for almost an hour before the firemen could get it under control. Although the furniture in 

the small room that stood close to the door was totally destroyed, the door prevented the 

fire from entering the main room. The old wood plate of the door was burnt on the side 

facing the small room but remained intact on the other side.

Document D3: Emergency exit sliding door 

 

[0001] The invention relates to a door for an emergency exit. It is necessary to provide 

emergency exits for evacuating people from a public building. Particularly in crowded 

spaces there is the risk that people panic and try desperately to exit to a safe place. Any 

obstacles on the exit routes hinder the escape of people and can cost lives.  

 

[0002] Pivoting doors in emergency exits normally open to the outside so that they swing 

out of the way of the exiting people. However, with sliding doors, the doors have to be 

slid to the side and can be blocked when a mass of people pushes against the door leaf. 

 

[0003] To provide a solution to this problem, the invention proposes a sliding door 500 

that can be used as an emergency exit door. This sliding door comprises a door leaf 501 

guided in a slidable manner within a door frame 502 as well as a cable 503 and a weight 

504 biasing the door leaf into the fully opened state as shown in the figure. To close, the 

door leaf 501 has to be moved against the biasing force of the weight 504 into the fully 

closed state (to the left in the figure). The door has a lock with a hook-like member 505 

that holds the door leaf in its closed position. The lock has a panic handle 506 on the 

interior side. Pushing against the panic handle 506 releases the lock; and the door leaf 

501 is immediately moved into the fully opened position enabling the people to exit. To 

ensure a safe function, the biasing mechanism can be hidden within the internal spaces 

in the door frame 502. 

 

[0004] To facilitate the movement of the door leaf 501, the door leaf 501 is made of light 

and thin board containing fibres such as cardboard. Since the door 500 is only used as 

an emergency exit door, layers of any material such as aluminium or wood can be used 

as the outer surfaces.

QUESTION 19 

 

For each of the statements 19.1 to 19.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false. 

 

19.1 
An element of the objective technical problem solved by the subject-matter of 

claim II.2 over D1 is to simplify the construction. 

19.2 
An element of the objective technical problem solved by the subject-matter of 

claim II.2 over D1 is to provide fire protection doors imitating the appearance of 

ancient doors. 

19.3 
A valid argument as to why a skilled person would not combine D1 and D2 to 

arrive at the subject-matter of claim II.2 is that D1 is a patent document and D2 

is a journal in the field of vintage art. 

19.4 
A valid argument as to why a skilled person would combine D1 and D2 is that 

D1 discloses a door leaf for a fire protection door and D2 teaches that a solid 

wood plate is a suitable material for a door leaf that prevents propagation of fire.

QUESTION 20 

 

As auxiliary request, the patent is defended in the opposition with the following 

independent claim: 

 

Fire protection door comprising a door leaf, a door frame and a door closer, the door leaf 

comprising a plate made of solid wood, 

wherein the door is a pivoting door and wherein the door leaf is pivotably connected to 

the door frame by means of hinges; 

characterised in that 

a) 
the major surfaces of the plate are fully covered with an aluminium layer, 

b) 
the material of the plate is treated such that it releases moisture when heated, 

and 

c) 
the door leaf has a stepped edge engageable with a step in the door frame. 

 

The opponent cites D2 as closest prior art with regard to this claim. The opponent 

acknowledges that the subject-matter of the claim of the auxiliary request differs from D2 

in the features of the characterising portion of the claim. 

 

The opponent defines the objective problem with regard to D2 as to enhance the fire 

protection function of a fire protection door. 


Claim analysis

Page 31 of 33 

For each of the statements 20.1 – 20.4, indicate by marking true or false on the answer 

sheet whether the statement is a valid argument as to why it is not obvious to solve the 

stated objective technical problem by the features of the claim.  

 

20.1 
Although D3 discloses a door leaf covered by an aluminium layer, there is no 

teaching in D3 that this could improve a fire protection function. 

20.2 
Although D1 discloses a material that is such that it delivers moisture when 

heated, there is no teaching that solid wood of D2 could replace the material of 

D1. 

20.3 
Although the figure of D1 shows a small step on the side of the door leaf due to 

an overlap of metal sheets, this step is only because two edge portions of the 

metal sheets overlap; there is no teaching to combine a step in a door leaf with 

a step in a door frame to come to a better sealed door gap. 

20.4 
D1 teaches away from using aluminium in fire protection doors.
