Instructions for answering the paper and marking scheme 

2018/P/EN/1 

1. 
The pre-examination is in the form of a multiple choice paper. It comprises 20 
questions in all, 10 questions relating to legal knowledge (questions 1-10) and 10 
questions relating to the analysis of claims (questions 11-20). Questions must be 
answered by filling in the circles on the answer sheet printed on the reverse side of your 
personal cover sheet. The duration of this examination is four hours. 
 
(a) 
Each question X has 4 separate statements, namely X.1, X.2, X.3 and X.4. For 
each statement X.1, X.2, X.3 and X.4 candidates must unambiguously indicate on the 
answer sheet whether the statement is true or false. For each statement X.1, X.2, X.3 
and X.4 only one answer can be given, either true or false. Each statement within a 
question is to be considered independently of the other statements.  
 
(b) 
To indicate that a statement X.1, X.2, X.3 or X.4 is true, the corresponding circle 
for “true” should be filled using a black medium soft HB pencil. To indicate that a 
statement X.1, X.2, X.3 or X.4 is false, the corresponding circle for “false” should be 
filled using a black medium soft HB pencil. 
 
(c) 
If, in reply to a statement X.1, X.2, X.3 or X.4, no indication is given as to whether 
the statement is true or false, or if both true and false are indicated, then the answer to 
this statement will be deemed not to be correct. Accordingly, if a candidate fills or partly 
fills a circle they do not intend to submit as part of their answer, it is essential that any 
mark in that circle is fully erased.  
 
(d) 
There is no possibility for submitting notes or remarks to the examiner. Any such 
submission will be disregarded.

Legal questions 

2018/P/EN/4 

Question 3 

 

The European patent application EP-A was filed on 29 February 2016. EP-A claims 

priority from an earlier patent application filed in March 2015. The mention of the grant of 

a European patent based on EP-A was published in April 2017. An opposition against 

this patent was validly filed in January 2018. The only ground for opposition raised by 

the opponent is lack of novelty according to Article 100(a) EPC. The only document cited 

is the French patent application FR-B published in July 2015 and filed in January 2014. 

In the notice of opposition, the opponent argues that the priority claimed in EP-A is not 

valid.  

 

For each of the statements 3.1 – 3.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

3.1 
The validity of the priority right as such is not a ground for opposition under 

Article 100 EPC.  

3.2 
FR-B is state of the art under Article 54(2) EPC if the priority of EP-A is not valid.  

3.3 
If the priority of EP-A is valid, then FR-B belongs to the state of the art under 

Article 54(3) EPC in view of its earlier filing date. 

3.4 
If the opponent raises today, 26 February 2018, an objection of lack of sufficiency 

of disclosure against EP-A, then this is a fresh ground for opposition.

Claim analysis 

2018/P/EN/12 

Description of the Client's Patent Application 

 

[001] The present invention relates to jugs or filter carriers for mounting on jugs with 

replaceable filter cartridges for filtering water. 

 

[002] In such jugs or filter carriers the filtering capacity of the cartridges is subject to 

exhaustion, and therefore the cartridges must be replaced after a certain number of 

filtering cycles and/or after a predetermined period of activity of the cartridge.  

 

[003] Jugs or filter carriers provided with counting devices are known. Typically the 

counting devices are installed on the lid and are incremented manually when the jug is 

filled thereby indicating the number of filtering cycles. A drawback of this solution lies in 

the fact that the counting device requires an operation to be carried out manually by the 

user. Furthermore, the opening of a flap on the lid also involves manual operation. Thus, 

filling the jug requires the use of both hands, one to hold the jug and the other to open 

the flap and to increment the counter. 

 

[004] It would be desirable to provide a jug where the amount of water filtered and 

therefore the level of exhaustion of the filter could be determined accurately. It would be 

desirable if the jug were easy to manipulate when filling and also when incrementing the 

counter indicating the number of times water has been added to the jug. 

 

Brief description of the drawings: 

 

[005] Figures 1 and 2 are two schematic sectional views of a lid which can be fitted on a 

jug or a filtering means having a replaceable filter according to a first embodiment. 

 

[006] In Figures 1 and 2, reference 1 indicates a jug for filtering. The jug 1 has a 

replaceable filter cartridge and comprises a lid 3, in which an aperture 4 is provided for 

the introduction of the water to be filtered.  


Claim analysis 

2018/P/EN/13 

[007] On the lid 3, at the aperture 4, a blocking mechanism 5 is mounted so as to pivot 

on a hinge 6 between a first, closed position in which it closes the aperture 4, as shown 

in Figure 1, and a second, open position in which it extends into the jug, as shown in 

Figure 2. Although in these figures the blocking mechanism is shown to pivot in a 

clockwise direction towards the closed position, it would be clear to a skilled person that 

were the jug turned such that the handle 16 is on the left side of the figures the blocking 

mechanism would pivot in an anti-clockwise direction towards the closed position.  

 

[008] The blocking mechanism 5 is secured to the lid 3 by means of a hinge 6 and 

comprises, on opposite sides of the axis of the hinge 6, a flap 7 that moves towards the 

lid 3 to close the aperture 4, and an arm 8 inclined with respect to the flap 7, such that, 

in the second, open position of the blocking mechanism 5 the arm 8 is brought close to 

the lid 3. 

 

[009] The lid 3 comprises a biasing means associated with the blocking mechanism 5 to 

bias the blocking mechanism 5 towards the first, closed position. The biasing means 

allows the blocking mechanism 5 to pass into the jug into the second, open position 

under the action of the flow of water through the aperture 4. In this first embodiment 

shown in Figures 1 and 2, the biasing means comprises a helical spring 9. The opposing 

ends of the helical spring 9 are secured, respectively, to the arm 8 and to the lid 3. 

 

[010] A counter 11 on the lid 3 comprises a display means 15 for the count value, 

electrically connected to a detector 12. The detector 12 is a proximity detector, with a 

magnet 13, fixed on the opposite end of the flap 7 from the hinge 6, and a magnetic 

detector 14 fixed in a corresponding position on the lid 3. The magnet 13 and the 

magnetic detector 14 are close together when the blocking mechanism 5 is in the first, 

closed position. This provides a jug that can be filled and the counter incremented 

without the need to use both hands. 


Claim analysis 

2018/P/EN/14 

[011] As shown in Figure 2, the passage of the flow of water going into the jug 1 through 

the aperture 4 causes the pivoting of the blocking mechanism 5 from the first, closed 

position to the second, open position. 

 

[012] The interruption of the passage of the flow of water results in the return of the 

blocking mechanism 5 from the open position to the closed position by the action of the 

helical spring 9. The magnetic detector 14 detects a change in magnetic field resulting 

from the magnet 13 moving towards the magnetic detector 14. The magnetic detector 14 

then actuates the counter 11, increasing (or decreasing) by one unit the number 

indicated by the display means 15. The invention thus provides an advantage of 

automatically counting the filtering cycles in order to determine the level of exhaustion of 

the cartridge by the action of the water introduced into the jug, rather than requiring 

manual intervention by the user. 

 

[013] In a second embodiment (not shown) the detector is of the type with electrical 

contacts instead of the magnet and magnetic detector such that the relevant circuit is 

closed when the contacts contact each other and is open when they are distanced from 

each other. The counter is incremented in response to detecting a change in electric 

current caused by the contacts contacting each other.  

 

[014] The third embodiment (not shown) provides an alternative detector comprising 

electrodes, which when immersed in a conductive liquid such as water, close a circuit 

which increments a counter. Thus, the counter is incremented in response to the water 

in the jug submerging the electrodes by reaching or exceeding a predetermined level. 

One problem with detectors that detect water level is that movement of the water, e.g. 

when the water is poured from the jug, may result in a false positive. 


Claim analysis 

2018/P/EN/15 

[015] Although the first, second and third embodiments relate to a lid on a jug, in an 

alternative embodiment the lid may be a lid on a filter carrier. In this alternative 

embodiment the filter carrier comprises the lid, a reservoir for holding water, a 

replaceable filter cartridge and an outlet through which filtered water is output.

Document D1 

 

[001] A jug for filtering water is provided with a counting device, typically installed on the 

lid, to indicate the number of filtering cycles carried out since a filter cartridge within the 

jug was last replaced, in order to determine the level of exhaustion of the filter cartridge. 

The number indicated by the device is incremented each time the user opens the lid of 

the jug. 

 

[002] Figures 1 to 3 illustrate three examples of the jug according to three different 

embodiments. Each embodiment shows a jug 101 comprising a replaceable filter 

cartridge 102, a lid 103 and a counter 111. The configuration of the lid and counter is 

different for the three embodiments. 

 

[003] Figure 1 shows a first embodiment with a lid 103 with a flap 105 which is manually 

moved to open or block an aperture 104 in the lid. In this embodiment the flap 105 is slid 

to open or close the aperture. When in the open position flap 105 contacts an 

actuator/detector 116 associated with counter 111 causing the counter 111 to increment. 

In this way in order to fill the jug the flap 105 is manually moved from the closed to the 

open position revealing aperture 104 and resulting in the automatic incrementation of the 

counter 111. 

 

[004] Figure 2 shows a second embodiment where the flap 105 is manually pivoted 

away from the base of the jug to open aperture 104. The detector 116 detects the 

proximity of the flap 105 and transmits an incrementing signal to counter 111 in 

response to detecting the flap moving from the open to the closed position. 


Claim analysis 

2018/P/EN/18 

[005] Figure 3 shows a third embodiment where the counter 111 is manually 

incremented by a user pressing actuator/detector 116. Thus, a user can determine when 

the jug has been filled and increment the counter. In this way a record is kept of how 

many times the jug has been filled allowing a user to determine when it is time to replace 

the filter cartridge.

Document D2 

 

[001] A water-purification jug having a filter cartridge that is subject to exhaustion is 

disclosed. A need has emerged to provide a system which can indicate to the user the 

moment at which it is necessary to replace the exhausted cartridge. 

 

[002] It is known, for example, to provide counting means associated with a removable 

lid of the jug, for counting the number of lid-opening and lid-closure cycles. This 

measurement clearly lacks reliability since it is in no way correlated with a direct 

measurement of the amount of water introduced into the jug. 

 

[003] An object of the invention is to provide a jug in which the amount of water treated 

by the filter cartridge is accurately determined. 

 

[004] Brief description of the drawings: 

Figure 1a is a schematic, side elevational and sectioned view of a lid on top of a filter jug 

formed in accordance with a first embodiment; 

Figure 1b shows the same embodiment as Figure 1a, with the aperture closed; 

Figure 2 is a view similar to Figures 1a and 1b of a lid on a filter jug formed in 

accordance with a second embodiment. 

 

[005] The jug 201 comprises a container 217 being closed by a removable lid 203. The 

lid 203 has a conduit 204 for the introduction of water to the jug 201.  

 

[006] Figures 1a and 1b show a first embodiment. The jug 201 comprises a detector 212 

for measuring the flow of water introduced into the jug 201 through the conduit 204 and 

a counter 211 for counting signals received from the detector. 

 

[007] The detector 212 comprises a turbine wheel 213 comprising blades 213a 

extending radially across the cross-section of the conduit 204.  


Claim analysis 

2018/P/EN/21 

[008] A magnet on one or more blades 213a of the turbine wheel 213 is detected by a 

magnetic detector associated with the flexible guide 214. The counter 211 counts the 

number of times the one or more blades 213a of the turbine wheel 213 contact the 

flexible guide 214. 

 

[009] The blade closes the conduit each time that it contacts the flexible guide. Thus, the 

flexible guide and blade act as a blocking means for blocking the conduit. When the 

counter value indicates that the total amount of water introduced to the jug is such that 

the current filter cartridge is exhausted, use of the filter can be prevented by the rotation 

of the turbine wheel being stopped in a position where a blade is in contact with the 

flexible guide. This is shown in Figure 1b, while Figure 1a shows the conduit open.  

 

[010] Figure 2 schematically shows a second embodiment where there is no flexible 

guide and where the blades of the turbine wheel mechanically increment a counter 211 

by connecting with an actuator/detector 216. In this case there is no way of blocking the 

entry of water when the filter cartridge is exhausted.

characterised in that the blocking mechanism is displaced under the action of the 

flow of water into the jug. 


Claim analysis 

2018/P/EN/29 

Assuming for this question the claims are considered to be new and inventive, for each 

of the statements 16.1 – 16.4 indicate on the answer sheet whether the statement is true 

or false. 

 

16.1 Claims IV.1 and IV.2 fulfil the requirements of Rule 43(2) EPC because they 

relate to inter-related products.  

16.2 Claims IV.1 and IV.2 fulfil the requirements of Rule 43(2) EPC because they 

relate to different uses of an apparatus. 

16.3 A valid argument for claims IV.1 and IV.2 lacking unity of invention is that 

claim IV.1 does not comprise a filter cartridge.  

16.4 Claims IV.1 and IV.2 have a common special technical feature with respect to D1.

Document D3 

 

[001] A container lid with an opening for filling the container, the opening being provided 

with a movable closing element, is disclosed. Such container lids are used on all sorts of 

containers for liquids, particularly for beverages, such as jugs for boiling water, or water 

filters in order to protect the contents of the container. 

 

[002] Container lids without an opening for filling protect the contents against 

contamination but need to be completely removed to fill the container. Removing and 

reapplying the container lid is disadvantageous because time is required and 

manipulation is awkward and furthermore, the attachment means are subjected to 

unnecessary wear.  

 

[003] Figure 1a shows a vertical section through a container lid with the closing 

mechanism in the closed position according to an embodiment; and 

Figure 1b shows the lid shown in Figure 1a with the closing mechanism in the position of 

partial opening; and 

Figure 1c shows the lid shown in Figure 1a with the closing mechanism in the position of 

opening. 

 

[004] A container lid 301 is provided that has an opening 304 for filling and a blocking or 

closing mechanism 305 for closing the opening 304, the closing mechanism 305 being 

mounted on the lid and adapted to rotate around an axis. The closing mechanism 305 is 

in the closed position at rest (Fig. 1a) where it blocks the opening 304 and moves from 

this rest position into the open position only when liquid 319 is poured into a cup 305a 

associated with the closing mechanism 305 (Fig. 1b, 1c). The impact provided by the 

liquid 319 moves the closing mechanism 305 into an open position. When the filling 

operation is completed, the closing mechanism 305 rotates automatically to the closed 

position under the action of a counterweight 309 which acts as biasing means. In this 

way, closing of the opening is ensured, when not being filled, without manual 

intervention by the user.

Question 17 

 

Consider for questions 17 and 18 that the following claims were filed with the application 

and that in addition to documents D1 and D2 the document D3 was cited in the search 

report 

 

V.1 A jug for filtering water, comprising:  

− a lid; 

− an aperture provided through the lid for the filling of the jug; 

− a blocking mechanism mounted on the lid at the aperture and displaceable 

between a closed position, in which it closes the aperture, and an open position;  

− a detector for detecting the number of times water is added to the jug;  

− a counter configured to increment in response to a signal received from the 

detector;  

− a biasing means associated with the blocking mechanism for biasing the 

blocking mechanism towards the closed position as a rest position;  

characterised in that the blocking mechanism is configured to pivot towards the 

base of the jug when moving from the closed to the open position and in that the 

biasing means is configured to allow the blocking mechanism to move into the 

open position under the action of the flow of water introduced into the jug through 

the aperture. 

 

V.2  A jug according to claim V.1, wherein the detector is able to detect water within the 

jug reaching a predetermined level.  


Claim analysis 

2018/P/EN/33 

Consider for this question that document D1 corresponds to the closest prior art and 

discloses the preamble of claim V.1, but not the characterising portion. 

 

For each of the statements 17.1 – 17.4 indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false. 

 

17.1 A technical effect of the features of the characterising portion of claim V.1 is that 

the blocking mechanism can open automatically in response to a flow of water.  

17.2 A valid objective technical problem addressed by claim V.1 with respect to D1 can 

be formulated as how to provide a jug that is easy to manipulate when filling. 

17.3 A valid argument as to why D3 would not be combined with D1 is that D3 is 

directed to a lid that is not used with a filtering device.  

17.4  A valid objective technical problem addressed by claim V.1 with respect to D1 can 

be formulated as how to provide a blocking mechanism for a filter lid that only 

opens in response to a flow of water. 


Claim analysis 

2018/P/EN/34 

Question 18 

 

For question 18, assume that document D1 is the closest prior art for claim V.2 and the 

distinguishing features are the following: 

1) the blocking mechanism is configured to pivot towards the base of the jug when 

moving from the closed to the open position;  

2) the biasing means is configured to allow the blocking mechanism to move into the 

open position under the action of the flow of water introduced into the jug through the 

aperture; and  

3) the detector is able to detect water within the jug reaching a predetermined level.  

 

For each of the statements 18.1 – 18.4 indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false. 

 

18.1 A technical effect of distinguishing feature 3) is that an indication of an amount of 

water in the jug is provided.  

18.2 A valid formulation for an objective technical problem with respect to 

document D1 for distinguishing feature 3) might be how to more accurately 

determine the number of times water is added to a jug. 

18.3 A valid formulation for an objective technical problem for distinguishing feature 3) 

might be how to provide a detector for detecting water being added to a jug that 

can only generate a signal for incrementing a counter in response to water being 

added to the jug. 

18.4 For the assessment of inventive step of claim V.2 it is a valid argument that none 

of the documents D1, D2 or D3 disclose a water level detector.

Document D4 

 

[001] A water filter jug with a replaceable cartridge is disclosed. 

 

[002] Fig. 1 is a schematic view in cross-section of a filter jug according to an 

embodiment of the invention and 

Fig. 2 shows a further view of the filter jug being filled. 

 

[003] Fig. 1 shows a filter jug 401. Lid 403 is provided with a flap 405 which blocks an 

aperture 404 of the jug 401. The flap 405 is moved inwards around a hinge under the 

action of a user’s hand or the insertion of a tap 430 (see Fig. 2). The flap 405 is biased 

to return to a closed position when the hand or tap are removed. 

 

[004] Counting means to count the filtering cycles performed are provided in order to 

determine the level of exhaustion of filter cartridge 402. The counting means comprise a 

floating level indicator. This floating level indicator comprises a float 413 as well as 

proximity detectors 414a, 414b, 414c, 414d, 414e, 414f, 414g which detect the position 

of the float. 

 

[005] Detector 414g, which is used to detect a condition in which the filter jug is 

completely empty (reference level) is located close to the bottom of the filter jug, while 

the other detectors are located at higher positions. 

 

[006] During use, water is added to chamber 417a and flows through filter cartridge 402. 

As the water level in the filter jug 401 rises the float 413 is displaced from detector 414g 

to a higher detector. Each detector generates a counting signal in response to detecting 

the float and the counting signals generated are then summed by a calculating unit 411 

which generates a display indicating the level of exhaustion of the cartridge.

Question 19 

 

For questions 19 and 20 assume that claim VI.1 was filed with the application, the prior 

art cited is documents D1 to D4 and that the claim is in the two-part form with respect to 

D4. 

 

VI.1 A jug for filtering water, comprising:  

− a lid; 

− an aperture provided through the lid for the filling of the jug; 

− a blocking mechanism mounted on the lid at the aperture and displaceable 

between a closed position, in which it closes the aperture, and an open position 

in which it pivots around a hinge towards the base of the jug; 

− a biasing means for biasing the blocking mechanism towards the closed position 

and allowing it to open under an external force such as that supplied by water 

being added to the jug; 

− a detector; 

− a counter configured to increment in response to a signal received from the 

detector;  

characterised in that the detector is configured to detect the blocking mechanism 

moving from the open to the closed position. 


Claim analysis 

2018/P/EN/38 

For each of the statements 19.1 – 19.4 indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false. 

 

19.1 A valid argument for document D4 being considered to be the closest prior art to 

claim VI.1 is that D4 is the only prior art document that comprises a water level 

detector.  

19.2 A valid argument for document D4 being considered to be the closest prior art to 

claim VI.1 is that only document D4 addresses the same technical problem as 

claim VI.1, namely improvement of the accuracy of a means for detecting the 

level of exhaustion of a filter.  

19.3 A valid argument for document D4 being considered to be the closest prior art to 

claim VI.1 is that D4 is the only document that discloses a jug that has a blocking 

mechanism that moves into an open position by pivoting towards the base of the 

jug.  

19.4 If one considered document D4 to be the closest prior art, a valid objective 

technical problem could be formulated as how to provide a jug that can be filled 

without the need to manually move the lid.  


Claim analysis 

2018/P/EN/39 

Question 20 

 

For question 20 assume that: 

a) document D4 is the closest prior art and discloses the preamble of claim VI.1; and 

b) the objective technical problem is how to provide an alternative means of determining 

the level of exhaustion of a water filter cartridge.  

 

For each of the statements 20.1 – 20.4 indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false. 

 

A valid argument as to why … 

 

20.1 … the skilled person starting from document D4 and faced with the objective 

technical problem would not consider the teaching of D1 is that D1 provides a 

less accurate means of determining the level of exhaustion of a filter.  

20.2 … claim VI.1 is inventive over a combination of document D4 and the third 

embodiment of D1 is that even if the skilled person were to consider incorporating 

the lid of the third embodiment onto the jug of D4 to solve the objective technical 

problem, he would not arrive at a jug according to claim VI.1. 

20.3 … claim VI.1 lacks an inventive step, is that the skilled person starting from 

document D4 and faced with the objective technical problem would replace the lid 

of D4 with the lid of D2 as this provides an alternative means for measuring the 

level of exhaustion of a filter and would thereby arrive at a jug according to the 

subject-matter of claim VI.1. 

20.4 … the skilled person starting from document D4 and faced with the objective 

technical problem would not consider the teaching of D3 is that D3 does not teach 

a means for detecting the level of exhaustion of a filter.
