A153EPC 

R154(1) EPC + 31 m 

R131(4) EPC 
07 March 2017 i.e. today 

To get first invention granted as European patent as soon as possible, the applicant 

must: 

enter EP regional phase by completing acts according to Art 153 EPC, Rule 159(1) EPC 

R159(1),(a) EPC: translation not required as EPO was rO and languages accepted by 

EPO as rO are R157(2) EN/FR/DE same as Art 14(1) EPC. 


- 2 - 
 

R159(1)(b) EPC specify documents on which European grant is to be based – application  

as filed since want both inventions searched and  no amendments filed 

 

R159(1)(c) EPC pay filing fee Rfees 2(1), item 1 plus additional page fees, if required. 

 

R159(1)(d) EPC pay designation fee Rfees 2(1) item 3 since by A153(6) EPC, the ISR 

takes the place of the search report, which was published in Feb 2015 and thus 6m 

period under R39(1) EPC has expired. 

 

R159(1)(e) EPC supplementary search will be dispensed with as EPO acted as ISA 

R164(2) EPC but Examining Division will inform applicant that search will be performed 

for any invention i.e. claim 2 for which search fee is paid (Rfees 2(1) item 2) within a 

period of 2 months R164(2) EPC.  In this way, second invention searched. 

 

The Examining Division will issue the results of the search and give applicant opportunity 

to comment R164(2)(b) EPC. 

 

This follows procedure of OJ 2014, A70, GL C-III, 2.3. 

 

To accelerate this, wave right to R161/162 EPC communication OJ 2011, 354, E-VIII, 

3.1. 

 

R159(1)(f) EPC file request for examination and pay examination fee Rfees 2(1) item 6 

since  period under Rule 70(1) has expired (of designation fee). 

 

R159(1)(g) pay renewal fee in respect of 3rd year Rfees 2(1) item 4 
anniversary 

was 07 Aug 2016, due 31 Aug 2016, due upon entry into regional phase 31 months 

today. 

 

R159(1)(h) file, if applicable, certificate of exhibition. 

 

To accelerate further, file request for PACE online using Form 1005 GL C-VI, 2 OJ EPO 

2015, A93.

b) 
EPO cannot act as SISA since acted as ISA R45bis.9(b) PCT. 

 

Enter EP regional phase as outlined above. 

 

The EPO will inform applicant as R164(2)(a) that additional search fee is to be paid – pay 

this Rfees 2(1) item 2 within 2 months and examining division will issue search results.  

R164(2)(b)EPC. 

 

Applicant can then choose which invention claim 1 or claim 2 to pursue in this application

TEL2 sales. 

 

TEL2 is patentable if meets requirements of Arts 52-57 EPC. 

 

Here, pertinent are novelty Art 54 and inventive step Art 56 since invention industrially 

applicable Art 57 EPC and is not excepted by Art 53 EPC. 

 

Television interview of June 2016 does not appear to be enabling. 

 

US-P discloses TEL1 and is first application for this subject matter, patentee is F.  TEL1 

appears novel Art 54 EPC, since no relevant prior art.  Inventive step unknown since no 

advantage mentioned. 

 

Availability of technical information via website from Aug 2016 made TEL1 available to 

the pubic – no agreement on secrecy GL G-IV, 7.2.2, access via internet deemed public 

GL G-IV, 7.5 – that password required and limited group not a bar to confidentiality GL G-


- 9 - 

IV, 7.5.1. Since technical information available, disclosure enabling.  Hence TEL1 A54(2) 

prior art from Aug 2016. 

EP-F-filed Dec 2016, claiming priority of US-P. 

However, claim of EP-F is to TEL2 while US-P discloses TEL-1.  That is, different 

invention. 

Thus, while 12 month period, same applicant, US is party to PC and priority may be 

claimed from US provisional application GL A-111, 6.2, 

OJ EPO 1996, 81, priority not validly claimed per Art 87(1) EPC for EP-F. 

Hence, website disclosure of August 2016 A54(2) prior art against EP-F.  EP-F is novel 

A54(2) over TEL-1 since TEL-2 includes ANT2, while TEL1 includes ANT1.  Since it is 

known since 2015 that ANT2 is better for indoor reception, it is obvious to combine 

replace ANT1 of TEL1 with ANT2, known from common general knowledge, so as to 

solve the problem over TEL1 of how to improve indoor reception.  Hence, claim of EP-F 

of TEL2 lacks an inventive step over TEL1 and ANT2, contrary to Art 56 EPC. 

Thus, TEL2 not patentable. 

Sales of TEL2 in Jan 2017 do not affect novelty of EP-F since after date of filing of EP-F.

This was missed. 

 

Priority period to validly claim priority from FR-NAT1  

 

Expired 
 
16 Feb 2016 

 
 
 
 
+ 12 months A8 PCT; A4C(1) PC

16 Feb 2017 

 


- 11 - 
 

Hence, PCT-G validly claims priority from FR-NAT1 

(same applicant, same invention, FR party to PC, within 12m Art 8 PCT). 

 

PCT-G did not claim priority from FR-NAT2. 

 

To add this claim to priority, A8; R26 bis.1(a) provides that the priority claim may be 

added by requesting  by a notice to EPO as rO or IB within latest of: 

 

a. 
4 months from filing date i.e. 

R26 bis1(a) PCT 

+ 4 m 

 
 
            14 Feb 2017   
   14 June 2017 

 
 
 
 
 
R80.2PCT 

 

 

 

b. 
earliest of: 16m from priority date i.e. 16 Feb 2016 

R26 bis1(a) PCT 

 

 
 
 
16 Feb 2016  + 16m  
16 June 2017 

                                               
   
 

 
 
 
 
    
   R80.2 

 

 
 
: 16m from changed priority date 

 
 
 
 
 
R26bis1(a) PCT 

 
 
 
 
 
+ 16m 

 
 
 
12 Feb 2016     
 
12 June 2017 

                                               
   R80.2 

 

Hence, latest is 14 June 2017 to add priority claim of FR-NAT2 to PCT-G. 

 

By R26bis2 PCT, rO will note that the priority claim to FR-NAT2 does not meet the 

requirements of R26bis2(a)(i) PCT i.e. IA has an international filing date later than the 


- 12 - 
 

expiration of the priority period and a request for restoration to the right of priority under 

R26bis.3 PCT has not been submitted, and invite the applicant to correct the priority 

claim. 

 

Since the international filing date is within 2 months of the expiry of the priority period, the 

EPO as rO shall notify the applciant of the possibility to request restoration under 

R26bis.3 PCT. 

 

The priority claim shall not be considered void during the international phase 

R26bis.2(c)(iii). 

 

b) 
The limit for entry into the European regional phase is 31 months from the (earliest 

claimed) priority date A153, R159(1) EPC. 

 

Without the addition of FR-NAT2, the date of entry into the European regional phase is: 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
R159(1) EPC 

 
 
 
 
 
 
+ 31m 

 

 
 
 
 
16 Feb 2016   
 
16 Sep 2018 

 
 
 
 
 
 
R131(4)EPC 

 

(calendar not provided for 2018) 

 

With addition of FR-NAT1, according to R26bis.1(c) PCT, the time limits which have not 

expired are to be recomputed using changed priority date i.e. 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
R159(1) EPC 

 
 
 
 
 
 
+ 31m 

 

 
 
 
 
12 Feb 2016   
 
12 Sep 2018 

 
 
 
 
 
 
R131(4)EPC 

 


- 13 - 
 

Hence, the date of entry into European phase brought forward. 

c) 
To avoid priority right to FR-NAT2 being deemed invalid before EPO as rO the 

applicant must request restoration of right of priority according to R26bis.3 PCT, to EPO 

as rO 

 

The request must 

 

R26bis.3(b)(1) be filed with EPO as rO within 2 months of expiry of priority period

the EPO as dO (R49ter.1(a) PCT) 
decision effective in each designated state 

(Euro-PCT Guide 133-140).  Applicant could request restoration of priority before EPO as

If fees not paid in due time, application deemed withdrawn A90(5) but further processing 

A121(1) not excluded under R135(R) EPC. 

 

b) 
The minimise fees: 

 

Filing fee reduced by 30% Rfees 14(1) under R6(3) EPC since applicant meets language 

requirements of A14(4), R6(3) EPC since Portuguese University comes under R6(4)(c).  

Must file in Portuguese, which is official language of contracting state.  Application may 

be in any language A14(1) EPC.  Declare as person within meaning of R6(4) EPC 

according to R6(6)EPC. 

 

Page fee determined fromn application in language as filed GL A-III, 13.2.

i.e. 2 pages fees due, also benefits from filing fee reduction of 30%, since part of the filing 

fee R38(2) EPC. 

 

Translation to be filed no earlier than concurrently, to benefit from filing fee reduction, but 

to be filed within 2 months of filing application R6(1) EPC.  To further reduce filing fee, file 

online (120 uros versus 210 euros). 

 

c) 
No.  Filing fee (including additional fee) and search fee covered by ADA 3.2(a)(b) 

By ADA 6.4, if insufficient funds, account holder is informed (email) and the payment is 

considered to be made on date account is duly replenished, (AAD8 also). 

 

The decisive payment date is last day for making payment AAD 6.1(a) i.e. 07 April 2017.  

Since paid on date account replenished, and since these fees not excluded from further 

processing under A121 R135(2) EPC, further processing fee Rfees 2(1) item 12 of 50% 

of search and filing fees also debited ADA 3.2(j).  Assuming sufficient funds.

Part II 

 

1a. 
Beams having projections formed by a rolling process where projections are of 

any shape. 

 

ST-GB1 is the first application for this subject matter, having an effective date of 23 Sep 

2013 since no earlier application and no priority claimed proprietor is STEELCO (SC). 

 

ST-GB1 describes and claims a metal beam having projections formed by rolling a metal 

strip between two rollers having teeth. 

 

Novelty – no relevant prior art – OLD1 relates to stamping rather than rolling.  Hence,  

claim novel. 

 

Inventive step – projections significantly improve strength and allow longer beams with 

thinner, cheaper metal strips. 

 

Suprising because widely accepted at time that beams without surface imperfections and 

projections would be stronger – hence, inventive. 

 

Sufficiency – appears sufficient. 

 

Thus, claim of ST-GB1 patentable since novel and inventive. 

 

However, ST-GB1 has lapsed so no rights available from ST-GB1 directly. 

 

ST-EP1 validly claims priority from ST-GB1 (same applicant, within 12m, includes 

description and claims of ST-GB1) and also discloses and claims this subject matter, as 

detailed above for ST-GB1. 

 

Proprietor: Steelco 

 


- 17 - 
 

Novelty: CB-EP is not A54(3) prior art and does not disclose projections of any type, 

since effective date of claim of ST-EP1 earlier than date of filing of CB-EP. 

 

Trade show also not A54(2) prior art for this subject matter since priority validly claimed. 

 

OLD1 is A54(2) but beam formed by stamping, not rolling. 

 

Inventive step – as above for ST-GB1. 

 

Hence, claim to metal beam having projections formed by rolling a metal strip between 

two rollers having teeth novel and inventive. 

 

Grant allowed – R71(3) comm received. 

 

STEELCO will be able to stop others from working this invention of claim in countries 

where validated upon/after grant.  See 2 below. 

 

CB-EP describes and claims a rolling process for forming metal beams by rolling a metal 

strip between a pair of rollers.  There is no mention of rollers having teeth or beams 

having projections. 

 

Proprietor: Chinabeam 

 

Effective date: 15 Oct 2013 

 

Novelty: ST-EP1 is A54(3) prior art, having earlier effective date of 23 Sep 2013.  Since 

ST-EP1 discloses beams having projections formed by rolling, ST-EP1 anticipates 

beams having no projections formed by rolling (species anticipates genus).  Hence, claim 

of CB-EP lacks novelty over ST-EP1, contrary to Art 54 EPC. Hence, not valid. 

 

Inventive step – none described. 

 

Sufficiency – appears sufficient. 


- 18 - 

Mention of grant was published on 08 June 2016 so Chinabeam can stop others from 

working this invention, despite invalidity, in countries where CB-EP validated – check 

national registries. 

1b. 
Projections of shape A 

ST-EP1 is the first application for this subject matter. 

Proprietor: Steelco 

While ST-EP1 claims priority from ST-GB1, ST-GB1 did not disclose this subject matter 

and hence effective date of claim to projections of shape A is date of filing of ST-EP1 i.e. 

15 Sept 2014. 

Novelty 

OLD1 is prior art but does not disclose this subject matter. 

CB-EP is A54(3) prior art but does not disclose beams having any projections. 

The trade fair in UAE of Nov 2013 was before the effective date and did make this 

invention available to the pubic – trade fair hence attended by persons skilled in the art, 

beams having Shape-A projections demonstrated, results presented and video of rolling 

process shown. 

Hence, novelty of this claim destroyed by trade fair disclosure and hence the claim of ST-

EP1 invalid. 

This is contrary to finding of EPO, which has allowed grant 71(3) issued.  Thus, if 

granted, while Steelco could attempt to stop others working this invention in countries 

where EP-ST1 validated after grant, claim is invalid and patent at risk of 

revocation/opposition. 


- 19 - 
 

CBEP was published ~ 15 Apr 2015 but does not disclose beams formed by rolling 

having any projections. 

 

ST-EP1 was published ~ 23 Mar 2015, content previously disclosed at trade fair in UAE, 

again does not  disclose projections  shape B. 

 

Article of 11 Apr 2016 after date of filing so not prior art. 

 

Hence, thus subject matter appears novel. 

 

Inventive step: shape B projections exhibit surprisingly considerably improved strength 

over beams with shape-A projections – hence inventive. 

 

Sufficiency – appears sufficient. 

 

Hence, claim to this subject matter patentable since novel and inventive. 

 

Steelco would be able to obtain grant to patent for this subject matter and stop others 

working it after grant + validation.  However, no fees paid to EPO for ST-EP2 and loss of 

rights notification received July 2016. 

 

Not possible for Steelco to obtain enforceable patent rights directly from ST-EP2. 

 

ST-EP3 validly claims priority from ST-EP2 (within 12m, successor in title, same subject 

matter,) so has an effective date for this subject matter (shape B) of 11 Mar 2016. 

 

Proprietor: Steelco 

 

However, ST-EP3 describes but does not claim shape-B projections so no patent to this 

subject matter may be granted to Steelco as it stands. 

 

Novelty and inventive step for this subject matter as for ST-EP2 above. 

 


- 20 - 
 

CB-PCT also claims priority to ST-EP2. 

 

However, this priority is not validly claimed because Mr G had transferred right to claim 

priority from ST-EP2 to Steelco prior to the filing of CB-PCT i.e. not successor in title. 

 

As it stands: 

 

CB-PCT has an invalid priority date of 11 Mar 2016, and an effective date for this subject 

matter of 10 Jun 2016 (date of filing of CB-PCT). 

 

Proprietor: filed initially by Mr G and Chinabeam, hence Mr G’s share assigned by 

Chinabeam.  Thus applicant is Chinabeam. 

 

Novelty: if CB-PCT enter EP regional phase, ST EP3 will be A54(3) prior art against CB-

PCT, having earlier effective date (date of priority of ST-EP2), thereby destroying novelty 

of claim to beam having projections formed by rolling of shape B of CB-PCT. 

 

As it stands, CB-PCT will enter EP regional phase 31m from claimed (invalid) priority 

date i.e. 11 Mar 2016 
11 Oct 2018 (2018 calendar not supplied). 

 

If priority claim withdrawn, will enter EP regional phase 10 June 2016 + 31m 
10 

Jan 2019. 

 

Inventive step – as per ST-EP2. 

 

If Chinabeam enters EP regional phase with CB-PCT having claim to this subject matter, 

grant likely as indicated above, if priority claimed allowed to remain invalid.  Otherwise, of 

priority claimed withdrawn, no grant as lacks novelty over ST-EP3/ST-EP2 A54(3) EPC. 

 

1c. 
Projections of shape B 

 

ST-EP2 is the first application for this subject matter, having an effective date of 11 Mar 

2016, since no priority claimed. 


- 21 - 
 

While filed by Mr G, ST-EP2 and right to claim priority to ST-EP2 transferred to Steelco 

on 04 Apr 2016 and registration recorded at EPO – instrument of transfer includes 

signatures of both parties, as required by R22(1). 

 

Hence, applicant: Steelco 

 

Novelty: OLD1 is prior art but does not disclose this subject matter. 

 

Trade fair in UAE is public disclosure under A54(2) but disclosed projections of shape A, 

not B. 

 

1d.  
Projections of shape B-1 

 

CB-PCT is the first application for this subject matter, having an effective date of 10 Jun 

2016. 

 

While priority of ST-EP2 invalidly claimed, ST-EP2 does not disclose this subject matter.  

Hence, no priority claim. 

 

Proprietor: Chinabeam 

 

Novelty: OLD1, UAE trade show, CBEP do are in the state of the art but do not disclose 

shape B-1. 

 

Article of 11 Apr 2016 disclosing ST-EP2/shape B is prior art but does not disclose shape 

B-1. 

 

Hence, claim is novel. 

 

Inventive step: beams with shape B1 projections have surprisingly much greater strength 

than beams with any other shape-B projections. 

 

Hence, inventive. 


- 22 - 

Sufficient 

Thus, claim novel + inventive – Chinabeam can expect grant of patent to this subject 

matter in countries where CB-PCT enters national/regional phase and where 

granted/validated after grant. 

ST-EP3 also discloses and claims projections of shape B. 

Effective date is 13 Jun 2016 since while priority to ST-EP2 claimed, ST-EP2 did not 

disclose this subject matter. 

Proprietor: Steelco 

Novelty: If CB-PCT validly enters EP regional phase as discussed above includes paying 

filing and translation, if required, CB-PCT will be A54(3) prior art and destroy novelty of 

ST-EP3 claim to shape-B projections. Hence, no grant possible.  However, if EP-PCT 

does not enter EP regional phase, grant expected as novel + inventive, as detailed above 

with reference to CB-PCT. 


- 23 - 
 

2. a.) CB-EP 

 

Date of mention of publication of grant:  08 Jun 2016 

 

File opposition by + 9m A99(1) EPC 
08 Mar 2016 

 

(tomorrow) 

 

Ground: lack of novelty over ST-EP1/ST-GB1 contrary to A54(3) EPC. 

 

ST-GB1/ST-EP1 discloses method of passing metal strips between two rollers each roller 

having teeth. 

 

This anticipates claim of CB-EP to rolling process for forming metal beams. 

 

Extent: whole patent. 

 

Revocation of patent CB-EP expected. 

 

Hence, Chinabeam will not be able to step Steelco working this. 

 

b.) 
CB-PCT 

 

CB-PCT does not validly claim priority to ST-EP2 since Mr G had assigned rights, 

including right to claim priority, to Steelco prior to filing of CB-PCT by Mr G and 

Chinabeam.  Hence, claim of CB-PCT to beams having projections of shape-B lacks 

novelty over disclosure of article of 11Apr 2016. 

 

In international phase, can file third party observations. 

 

If enter EP regional phase, third party observations may also be filed and EPO will 

consider priority issues. 

 


- 24 - 

If granted in EP, oppose CB-PCT. 

Then, Chinabeam cannot stop Steelco working this invention. 

c.) 
ST-EP1 

Claim 2 of ST-EP1 to beam having shape-A projections invalid over UAE trade show 

disclosure as discussed above. 

R71(3) response was due 

R126(2) 
+ 4m 

21 Oct 2016 + 10 d 
31 Oct 2016 
28 Feb 2017 

This has been missed. 

Further processing available – not excluded under R135(2) EPC 
do following by 28 

Apr 2017. 

File amended claim set, cancelling claim to beam having shape A projections but 

maintaining claim to beam having projections (claim 1).  Pay further processing fee.  EPO 

will re examine and issue another 71(3) 
can waive this to expedite need to file 

translations into other two languages – further processing fee also applicable. 

In this way, will obtain valid patent to a metal beam having projections formed by rolling a 

metal strip between two rollers having teeth, which Chinabeam will not be able to oppose 

on basis of UAE tradeshow, since priority valid.  Steelco will be able to stop anyone from 

working such invention – projections of any shape – in countries where validated after 

grant – include Spain. 

File translations in Spanish for provisional protection before grant – Nat Law Table IIIB. 


- 25 - 

d.) 
ST- EP3 

ST-EP3 describes but does not claim beam having projections of shape B-priority validly 

claimed. 

Amend claims to include this claim to shape B – keep claim to B1 in case CB-PCT does 

not enter EP regional phase. 

Steelco will be able to stop others from working this invention i.e. shape B and shape B1 

also – as dominant patent for shape B. 

File PCT application at EPO as rO by 11 Mar 2017 claiming projections shape B, 

claiming priority validly of ST-EP2 
ST-PCT.  Will be able to stop Chinabeam across 

world. 

3.
Assuming advice followed

CB-EP will be revoked in opposition.  Hence, dominant claim of CB-EP to rolling process 

for forming metal beams by rolling a metal strip between a pair of rollers will be revoked 

and Chinabeam cannot enforce this – hence Steelco free to form metal beams by this 

process. 

a)
ST-EP1 should grant with valid claim for a metal beam having projections formed

by rolling a metal strip between two rollers having teeth.  This is thus the dominant patent 

for such beams having projections of any shape and Steelco will be able to step 

Chainbeam in EPC countries where validated after grant, from working this invention.  

Validated in Spain, supply translation into Spanish within 3 months of grant Nat Law 

Table IV.  Thus, will be able to stop Chinabeam selling to Casitas in Spain, who will not 

be able to obtain from Chinabeam without infringement. 

Thus, order from Casitas not at risk. 


- 26 - 

Further, Steelco can stop Chinabeam selling beams having shape B1 in Europe, since 

ST-EP1 covers any shape. 

b)
When ST-EP3 grants, Steelco will be able to stop Chinabeam + others producing,

selling and using beams having projections type B in Europe, and B1 since broad enough 

to cover B (genus/species). 

c)
Steelco will not be able to stop any one from producing, sell or using beams

having projections of shape-A, since ST-EP1 anticipated by UAE trade fair disclosure. 

d)
If CB-PCT validly enters EP regional phase and patent granted for beams having

shape B1 projections, Chinabeam will be able to stop Steelco producing selling and using 

these.  However, Chinabeam will also require licence from Steelco for ST-EP3, which 

claims beams having shape B projections (dominant) . 

e)
Not possible via STEP 3 to stop sale in UAE.

However, using ST-PCT, will be able to stop Chinabeam in UAE + other countries where 

enter national/regional phases.
