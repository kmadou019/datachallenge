Part I: Legal Questions 

 

QUESTION 1 
(9 MARKS) 

 

On 17 February 2015, applicant A filed on the last day of the priority period European 

patent applications EP1 and EP2, together with copies of the earlier national British 

patent applications UK1 and UK2. UK1 and UK2 relate to different inventions. 

 

EP1 claims the priority of the earlier national patent application UK1. The description 

and claims of EP1 and UK1 are identical.  

 

EP2 claims the priority of the earlier national patent application UK2. The description 

and claims of EP2 and UK2 are identical. 

 

On 20 February 2015, the contents of UK1 and UK2 were made publicly available. 

 

Later the applicant noticed that he had forgotten to file the drawings for EP1. 

On 23 February 2015 he filed drawings for EP1 and he also filed drawings for EP2. The 

drawings for EP1 are identical to the drawings of UK1. The drawings for EP2 are newly 

drafted, because UK2 does not contain any drawings.  

 

Today, the applicant asks you what can be done to optimise the situation with regard to 

EP1 and EP2.

QUESTION 2 
(8 MARKS) 

 

Applicant B filed European patent application EP1 for invention X on 2 January 2011. 

EP1 duly claims priority of Italian utility model application IT1. IT1 was filed on 

2 January 2010 and was withdrawn before publication.  

 

In the search report of EP1, a scientific article published on 2 October 2010 was cited. 

The article discloses invention X. In October 2013 the EPO invited applicant B to file a 

translation of the previous application IT1 within a time limit of 4 months. In June 2014, 

applicant B received a communication under Rule 112(1) EPC noting a loss of rights 

because the translation of the previous application IT1 had not been filed. Applicant B 

has not taken any action in response to said communication. 

 

Recently, applicant B discovered European patent EP2 of company C filed on 

13 September 2010. The mention of the grant was published on 12 November 2014. 

EP2 claims invention X.  

 

a) 
Advise applicant B whether or not EP1 is likely to be granted by the EPO with a 

claim directed to invention X. 

 

b) 
Can anything be done against EP2 before the EPO?

QUESTION 3 
(9 MARKS) 

 

The German national Hans is working and living in Argentina. He is employed by Evita-

Engineering (EE), which is a company constituted under Argentinean law and is based 

in Buenos Aires. Hans and company EE validly filed a national patent application A at 

the competent authority in Argentina. It is intended to file today an international patent 

application PCT-A in English claiming priority of application A. In the PCT request, 

company EE and Hans are named as applicants.  

 

a) 
May PCT-A contain a declaration claiming the priority of application A? 

 

b) 
May Hans and company EE file PCT-A jointly? 

 

c) 
Which of the following offices will act as the receiving Office for PCT-A? 

 

 
1) 
The EPO,  

 

2) 
The government authority entrusted with the grant of patents of Germany 

(German Patent and Trademark Office, GPTO).

QUESTION 4 
(7 MARKS) 

 

On 24 March 2014 applicant D filed a national patent application JP-D in Japanese with 

the Japanese Patent Office. JP-D comprises an apparatus claim 1 and an apparatus 

claim 2. The subject-matter of claim 1 and the subject-matter of claim 2 are not linked by 

a common inventive concept. On 24 September 2014 applicant D filed European patent 

applications EP-D1 and EP-D2 both validly claiming priority of JP-D. EP-D1 was filed in 

Japanese and only discloses and claims the apparatus according to claim 1 of JP-D. A 

translation of EP-D1 into English was duly filed. EP-D2 was filed in English and only 

discloses and claims the apparatus according to claim 2 of JP-D. 

 

EP-D2 and the translation of EP-D1 wrongly use “©” instead of “µm”. JP-D correctly 

mentions “µm”. However, from the context in which “©” is used in the available English 

texts of EP-D1 and EP-D2, the replacement of “©” by “µm” would not be evident. 

 

Today (24 February 2015) your client wants to replace “©” by “µm”. Discuss how the 

subject-matter of claim 1 of JP-D and the subject-matter of claim 2 of JP-D can be 

prosecuted before the EPO on the basis of  documents reflecting your client’s wishes.

Part II: Legal Opinion 

 

[001] Our company TIPOGRAF-X is involved in printing and publishing, and is based in 

Venice, Italy. We specialise in high quality printing for which we are using old technology 

printing machines. We are mainly producing special editions of books, which are 

becoming more and more popular. 

 

[002] We are using an improved version of an old printing machine M. The first 

improvement our engineers carried out when we started our business was to add feature 

A, which allows the old printing machine M to increase its speed. At the time, this was a 

breakthrough for our firm, because the old machine M was too slow to be competitive. In 

February 2012 we presented, under a confidentiality agreement, a prototype of our 

machine M+A to German company DRUCK-Z, with whom we cooperate. In July 2012 

we filed, without claiming priority, a first European patent application EP-X1. EP-X1 

describes and claims our machine M+A. 

 

[003] In October 2013, we received the search report which cites a single document as 

prior art. To our surprise said document is a European patent application  

EP-Z filed by DRUCK-Z in March 2012 without claiming priority. EP-Z describes and 

claims our machine M+A. We immediately instituted proceedings against DRUCK-Z 

before a German court, to prove that we are entitled to the invention.

[004] Our engineers continued to improve the machine M+A to meet the increasing 

demand for our books. To be able to use various types of paper, feature B was added. 

At the same time, feature C was added. Feature C is independent of feature B and 

reduces the number of misprints produced by machine M+A. During the trials in our 

factory of a prototype machine with all the features, M+A+B+C, a surprising technical 

effect of the combination of features B and C was observed. The combination 

significantly reduces noise generated by the machine in operation. All these features 

and effects were described in a second European patent application EP-X2 which we 

filed on 10 March 2014 without claiming priority. EP-X2 has claims to the following 

combinations of features: M+A+B, M+A+C and M+A+B+C. 

 

[005] In December 2013 we found out by file inspection that EP-Z had been withdrawn 

in November 2013. 

 

[006] By a final decision of the German court dated 15 January 2015, it was adjudged 

that we were entitled to the grant of the European patent for machine M+A. Because we 

had already filed EP-X2 we did not pursue this issue any further. 

 

[007] Last year our engineers discovered that a feature D of the machine reduces the 

consumption of ink. This feature D is hidden in the machine and is not visible from the 

exterior, and only works together with the combination of features A+B+C.

[008] On 20 January 2015 we filed a third European patent application EP-X3 without 

claiming priority. The description of the application was the same as that of EP-X2 and it 

was intended to include an additional paragraph with a sufficient disclosure of feature D 

and its effect on the machine. Last week, however, we realised that when filing EP-X3 

we forgot to insert the additional paragraph of the description with the sufficient 

disclosure of feature D and its effect. We have not received any notification from the 

EPO concerning the absence of the sufficient disclosure of feature D. The single claim of 

EP-X3 is directed to the machine with all the features M+A+B+C+D. 

 

[009] At a trade fair in Italy on 10 -12 February 2015 we demonstrated a prototype of 

machine M+A+B+C+D. The machine was a big success and a lot of printing companies 

inquired about the machine. Therefore, we decided to manufacture and sell machine 

M+A+B+C+D. We will be ready to start producing the machine in summer 2015. Until 

now we have not disclosed any information about feature D to anybody. 

 

[010] At the fair, we saw a prototype of a machine M+A+C made by a Chinese 

company PRINT-L. We did not mention feature D to them, and it was clear that their 

machine did not include feature D. They are mainly active in the Asian market. They 

have filed a PCT application PCT-L, designating all countries. The International 

Preliminary Examination Report was positive. They now want to decide which national 

phases they should enter. PRINT-L was very interested in the machine we exhibited and 

mentioned the possibility of cooperating. Later, on file inspection, we saw that PCT-L 

was filed on 8 September 2012 without claiming priority and was published on 13 March 

2014. PCT-L describes machine M+A+C and contains a single claim which is directed to 

the combination M+A+C.

[011] Last week we received a letter from ICPR-G, which is a company manufacturing 

and selling printing machines only in Iceland. They informed us about their European 

patent application EP-G, which describes machines M+A and M+A+B and their 

respective advantages. EP-G contains a claim directed to M+A and a claim directed to 

M+A+B. EP-G was filed in May 2012 without claiming priority. They expect the EPO to 

grant a patent for EP-G. They warned us that the machine we exhibited at the fair would 

fall within the scope of this patent. Therefore, they proposed a licence but for a very high 

price. By file inspection we checked the search report for EP-G and noticed that it does 

not mention any relevant documents. I have a meeting with ICPR-G in three weeks to 

discuss the matter. 

 

1) 
What is the current situation concerning the following printing machines:  

 
M+A,  

 
M+A+B,  

 
M+A+C,  

 
M+A+B+C,  

 
M+A+B+C+D? 

 

2) 
As the situation currently stands, are we free to produce, sell and use our printing 

machine M+A+B+C+D? 

 

3) 
What can we do to improve our rights and our position vis-à-vis ICPR-G and 

PRINT-L with respect to the various printing machines mentioned above?
