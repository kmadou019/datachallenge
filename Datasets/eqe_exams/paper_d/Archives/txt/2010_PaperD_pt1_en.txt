QUESTION 1 
(4 points) 

 

Opponent O duly files an opposition to a European patent, the patent comprising an 

independent product claim 1 relating to product A and another independent process claim 2 

relating to process B. 

 

In the notice of opposition, O opposes the patent with respect to claim 1 only. The grounds 

and the reasoning relate to lack of inventive step. 

 

O does not make any further written submissions prior to the oral proceedings. 

 

At the beginning of the oral proceedings, O informs the opposition division that he had found 

by chance a highly pertinent prior art document Dn which destroys the novelty of both claims. 

Therefore, he argues that claims 1 and 2 are not novel and now requests the revocation of 

the patent in its entirety. 

 

What are the chances of success for the last request of the opponent? 

 

 

QUESTION 2 
(5 points) 

 

A European patent application EP-1 was filed claiming a football made of 33 patches of a 

special plastics material, PX. According to the description, the provision of the 33 patches 

made of PX is essential for achieving the surprising technical effect of improved flight 

characteristics. Furthermore, a method of stitching the patches together is disclosed but not 

claimed. No relevant prior art is available. DIV-1, a divisional application of EP-1, was filed 

shortly before EP-1 was withdrawn. DIV-1 discloses and claims only said football. DIV-2, a 

divisional application of DIV-1, was filed one week before DIV-1 was withdrawn. At the 

moment, only DIV-2 is pending. DIV-2 has the same description and claims as EP1.

Now the applicant wants to claim a football with any number of patches made of PX since he 

has found out that the technical effect can also be achieved with other numbers of patches 

made of PX. He further wants to have a claim to the stitching method. 

 

For what subject matter can the applicant have protection via DIV-2 and how? 

 

 

QUESTION 3 
(5 points) 

 

German applicant X duly filed a German patent application DE-X on 27.02.2009. X then 

wanted to file an international application PCT-X claiming the priority of DE-X. On 

25.02.2010, X sent PCT-X as a registered letter to the EPO in Munich. 

 

Normally, that letter would have arrived at its destination within two days of mailing. However, 

due to an accident of the delivery truck, the letter only reaches the EPO today, 02.03.2010. 

 

a) Has the priority been validly claimed?  

 

b) If not, what steps have to be taken to obtain a valid claim to priority?

QUESTION 4 
(4 points) 

 

Applicant A filed a Chinese patent application CN-A as a first filing on 01.07.2008. The 

subject-matter of the application is new and inventive. CN-A was published on 10.01.2010. 

On 21.12.2009, applicant A sends a letter with his letterhead by fax to the EPO indicating that 

he seeks a European patent. The letter contains neither description nor claims but a 

reference to previously filed CN-A. The subject-matter of CN-A was not made available to the 

public otherwise. The EPO communicates to the applicant the date of filing of EP-A as being 

21.12.2009. The applicant now intends to file an international application PCT-A claiming 

priority from EP-A. 

 

a) Which requirements did EP-A have to meet to get a date of filing accorded by the 

EPO.  

b) Discuss the legal situation of PCT-A. 

 

 

QUESTION 5 
(4 points) 

 

Your client, US company USCO, filed two international applications, PCT-U and PCT-E. 

PCT-U was searched by the USPTO as International Searching Authority (ISA). PCT-E was 

searched by the EPO as ISA. In each case, the ISA made a finding of lack of unity, with 

PCT-U containing inventions PCT-U1 and PCT-U2, and PCT-E containing inventions 

PCT-E1 and PCT-E2. Only inventions PCT-U1 and PCT-E1 were searched. In January 2010, 

both applications were duly regionalised before the EPO. The inventions first mentioned in 

the claims were PCT-U1 and PCT-E1, respectively.  

 

Your client now wants to prosecute the applications in the European phase on the basis of 

PCT-U2 and PCT-E2 only. How should he proceed?

QUESTION 6 
(5 points) 

 

 

Company X obtained a European patent with a single claim directed to a new product 

comprising compound C in the range of 3-40%. The grant was mentioned in the European 

Patent Bulletin on 09.11.2009. Company X filed a translation of the patent specification on 

22.01.2010 for Italy. Due to an error in the translation, compound C is specified to be in the 

range of 3-4% in the single claim. Thereafter the Italian company Y started to produce and 

sell the new product with 20% of compound C in Italy. 

 

Can company X stop company Y selling the new product with 20% of compound C in Italy? 

 

 

QUESTION 7 
(4 points) 

 

A European patent application EP1 was filed in English on 13.02.2008, validly claiming 

priority from Danish national application DK1 filed on 23.03.2007. The mention of the grant 

of EP1 is to be published in the European Patent Bulletin on 04.03.2010. The applicant 

desires to validate the patent in Denmark, France and Italy.  

 

a) When was the first renewal fee due to the EPO? 

 

b) When is the first renewal fee due to the national offices and until when can it be paid 

without surcharge? 

 

c) Which translations have to be supplied to the national offices?

QUESTION 8 
(5 points) 

 

A European patent application EP1 was filed on 16.01.2010 by reference to US patent 

application US1 and indicating that the reference also replaces the claims. US1 comprises a 

single independent claim 1 and 24 dependent claims. 

 

a) What claim fees have to be paid for EP1 and by when? The applicant wants to pay 

these fees as late as possible but to avoid any unnecessary payments. 

 

b) The applicant wants to reduce the number of claims and keep only claims 1-15. 

Which actions does he have to take? 

 

c) Advise whether the claims 16 – 25 could be reintroduced at a later stage in the 

proceedings and on possible costs. 

 

 

 

QUESTION 9 
(4 Points) 

 

Proprietor P received a communication from the Opposition Division according to  

Art. 101(1) EPC and dated 05.01.2009. In this communication P was invited to file  

observations in response to a submission of opponent O within a period of 4 months. 

 

Subsequent to the communication, a third party T provided evidence that he had instituted 

entitlement proceedings against P. As a consequence, the opposition proceedings were 

stayed as from 08.05.2009. Some time later, P received a communication informing him that 

the opposition proceedings were to be resumed as from 04.01.2010. T lost the entitlement 

proceedings. 

 

 When does the time limit set by the communication according to Art.101(1) EPC expire?
