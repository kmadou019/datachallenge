Candidate’s answer 
 
 
1. 
- 
You can achieve this objective as follows. 
- 
The fishing method disclosed in EPKM refers to EP1 as part of the direct 
disclosure of the invention. 
 
- 
The fishing method appears to be novel and inventive based on the Search 
Opinion issued in September 2009. 
 
- 
However, there is a problem with sufficiency of disclosure under A83 EPC, 
because the structure of the electromagnetic signal is essential for carrying 
out the invention. 
 
- 
EPKM discloses the signal structure only by reference to EP1. 
 
- 
This reference would need to be replaced by expressly incorporating the 
essential details of the signal structure into the description (Guidelines A-II 
4.19; T689/90). 
 
- 
However, the necessary reference can only be included if the reference 
document, i.e. EP1, is either publicly available on the filing date of EPKM 
(clearly here it was not) or it is both (a) available to the EPO on or before the 
filing date of EPKM and (b) published on or before the date of publication of 
EPKM (T737/90, Guidelines C-II 4.19). 
 
- 
Presently, EP1 has not been published as publication occurs approximately 
18 months from the date of filing (A93(1) EPC), i.e. around 12/1/09 + 18m = 
12/7/10. 
 
- 
The sufficiency of EPKM will therefore depend on whether EP1 publishes 
before EPKM itself publishes (EP1 already being available to the EPO and 
thus criterion (a) above being satisfied). 
 
- 
If no action is taken to prevent EP1 publishing, it will do so before EPKM 
because EP1 was filed a month earlier than EPKM.  In that case, EPKM would 
be sufficiently disclosed and, probably, allowable. 
 
- 
KA should therefore withdraw EP1 as soon as possible to avoid it being 
published.  The withdrawal should be effected well in advance of the 
completion of technical preparations for publication (5 weeks before 
publication – so early June 2010). 
 
- 
Once EP1 is withdrawn, KA should monitor for publication of EPKM and then 
consider (a) filing 3rd party observations to draw attention to the insufficiency 
disclosure during pendency of the EPKM application and/or (b) filing an 
opposition to EPKM when it grants based on lack of sufficiency, within the 9 
month post-grant opposition period. 
 
- 
In this case, 3rd party submissions may initially seem to be the better option as 
they are cheap, can be made anonymously and seem to have a high chance 
of success.  However, it is recommended instead to wait until EPKM grants 
and then to file an opposition.  The opposition should successfully prevent the 
claim to the fishing method; moreover, EPKM would likely not be able to 
amend the claims to instead cover the (apparently novel and inventive) 
combination of net and transmitter, because this would extend the scope of 
protection of the granted patent (A123(3) EPC). 


 
- 2 - 

 
- 
The lack of sufficiency attack outlined above will be preferable to any attack of 
lack of novelty and/or inventive step, e.g. made without withdrawing EP1 
because: 
(a) the public disclosure by KA at the 20/1/09 conference is not significant 
because it did not contain enabling disclosure of the signal; 
(b) in any case, EPKM’s disclosure of a combination of a fishing net and 
transmitters is apparently novel and inventive itself. 
- 
It is noted that it will most likely not be possible to file new applications 
(either KM or another party) to the fishing method or net/transmitter combination, 
because KM have already publicly disclosed this subject-matter on their website 
on 11/2/09. 
 
- 
For the avoidance of doubt that a combination of the general method of EP-KM 
and KA’s specific signal might still be found inventive if combined in a later 
application, KA could themselves now simply publicly disclose their combination 
(e.g. on their website, in their public library, etc.)  (It is noted that KA are not 
interested in protection for the fishing method). 
 
- 
Finally, it should be noted that it would not be advisable to withdraw EP1, but then 
to add a priority claim to EP1 in one of KA’s later filings (e.g. in EP3).  This is 
because the publication of the later application would then still occur before 
publication of EPKM (it being determined by the earliest priority date).  Upon 
publication of the later application, e.g. EP3, the text of EP1 would immediately 
become publicly available via the online file for the later application - hence 
EPKM would be sufficiently disclosed. 
 
 
2. 
- 
As indicated above, EP1 should be withdrawn as soon as possible. 
- 
EP2 contains apparently allowable claims to (1) the signal and (2) the filter, F1.  
(In fact, if EP1 was not withdrawn, it would on publication become a European 
prior right against EP1 and so take away the novelty of claim (1) of EP2 – this will 
not be a problem given that EP1 is being withdrawn). 
- 
Claim 3 of EP2, to the circuit C1, is apparently insufficiently disclosed. 
- 
EP3, as corrected by filing the missing description pages, has a filing date of 
2/2/10 and contains a sufficiently disclosed claim to C1. 
- 
However, this filing date is after the public disclosure of EP3 at the end of January 
2010 in KA’s public library.  It is not relevant that “no one has consulted” EP3 so 
far: this is still a disclosure under 54(2) because it has nonetheless been made 
available to the public (see, e.g. Guidelines C-IV 6.1). 
- 
All of the claims of EP3 would therefore lack novelty over the library disclosure (in 
addition, EP2 will on publication become a European prior right against EP3, 
destroying the novelty of claims to the signal and F1). 
- 
KA should therefore reply to the EPO notification to withdraw the missing parts of 
the description, i.e. pages 6 to 9. 
- 
The deadline for doing this is: 
 
 
Notification of 17/2/10 is deemed to be 27/2/10 (R126(2) EPC); 
 
 
Time limit is therefore 27/2/10 + 1 month = 27/3/10 (R56(6) EPC). 
- 
It will still be necessary to include pages 6 to 9 as these seem to be essential for 
disclosing F1 and thus the claimed combination F1+C containing the required 
electrical connection. 
- 
Therefore, at the same time or later than withdrawing the pages 6 to 9 under 
R56(6), the following action should be taken: 


 
- 3 - 

(1) 
A priority claim to EP2 should be added (deadline for taking this 
action is 1/3/09 + 16 months = Sat 1/7/10, R52(2), extended to 
Monday 3/7/10, R134(1); however, it must be done at the latest at 
the same time as taking step (2) below); and 
(2) 
A new request to incorporate pages 6 to 9 into EP3 by reference 
to EP2 should be made (deadline is 12/1/10 + 2 months = 12/3/10, 
R56(3) EPC.  This request will involve filing a copy of EP2 
(probably not strictly needed as EPO has a copy of EP2 already, 
but advised in view of close deadline), and indicating where the 
missing pages are found in EP2 (in this case, they correspond 
directly to pages 6 to 9 of EP2). 
- 
In view of the close deadline of 12/3/10, it is recommended to withdraw the 
current pages 6 to 9 and to carry out steps (1) and (2) in a single letter. 
- 
Once priority has been validly claimed from EP2 and the missing pages duly 
incorporated, EP3 will retain its original filing date, i.e. 12/1/10. 
- 
Accordingly, KA’s subject-matter will be divided and in Europe as follows: 
 
Electromagnetic Signal 
 
- 
Covered in EP2.  This claim appears novel and inventive over the 
20/1/09 conference and the EPKM internet disclosure as these do not 
have an enabling disclosure of the actual signal structure.  A similar point 
applies in relation to novelty over EPKM itself as a prior right. 
- 
There is also no evident intervening disclosure of the signal before the 
filing date of EP3.  EP3 also discloses the signal but priority cannot be 
claimed back to EP2 for this subject-matter because the first application 
was EP1 and this was still pending when EP2 was filed.  Nonetheless, to 
save costs, KA could consider withdrawing EP2 before publication if the 
risk of an intervening disclosure of the signal between 1/3/09 and 12/1/10 
is considered to be very small. 
- 
If EP2 is not withdrawn before publication, it will destroy the novelty of 
any claim in EP3 to the signal as a European prior right. 
- 
Note that addition of a priority claim in EP3 to EP1, to establish an 
effective date of 12/1/09, for the signal claim, is not recommended in 
view of the need to render EPKM insufficient – see Section 1 above for 
more details. 
 
F1 
 
- 
First disclosed, and claimed, in EP2.  It appears possible to prosecute 
this subject-matter to grant in EP2 and also in EP3 since EP3 validly 
claims priority of EP2.  In this situation, there may be double patenting 
issues at a national level post-grant.  Alternatively, F1 could be deleted 
from EP2 or EP3 (and clearly the situation is moot if EP2 is withdrawn as 
proposed above). 
 
C1 
 
- 
First enabling disclosure is in EP3.  There is no indication that this claim 
will not be allowable (EP2 even if maintained will not destroy novelty as a 


 
- 4 - 

European prior right because it does not disclose the electrical 
connection between F1 and C). 
 
Other Possible Claims 
 
- 
The following claims could also be added to EP3: 
� A claim to the electrical connection itself, which is said to be 
“inventive”. 
� A claim on underwater camera containing C1 (as disclosed already 
in the description). 
 
 
3. 
- 
Yes. 
- 
EPF has been validated in NO because when EPF was filed in February 2008 NO 
was an EPC member state and it is evident that validation occurred in all states. 
 
 
EP4 
 
- 
EP4 was filed in May 2007, i.e. before NO joined the EPC on 1/1/08. 
- 
EP4 has been published after, but has an earlier filing date (May 2007) than 
EPF’s priority date (October 2007).  EP4 is therefore a European prior right 
against EPF for novelty only. 
- 
EPF was itself filed in February 2008, i.e. after entry into force of EPC 2000.  
Therefore, A54(4) EPC 1973 does not apply (Dec Ad Council SE1 OJ 2007 197; 
OJ 2007 504).  EP4 is thus a European prior right for all states designated in 
EPF, including NO. 
- 
However, an opposition against EPF (or a national revocation action) based on 
EP4 would fail, because EP4 discloses only nets made from the generic class G, 
not nets made from the specific (“species”) material M.  The claims of EPF are 
therefore novel over the disclosure of EP4.  EP4 cannot be used to invalidate 
EPF. 
- 
(It follows that EPF was granted despite the citation of EP4 for the same reason). 
 
PCT-JU 
 
- 
PCT-JU was filed in May 2007 and so will designate NO (PCT member since 
1/1/1980). 
- 
PCT-JU also has an earlier filing date May 2007, than EPF’s priority date 
(October 2007).  PCT-JU therefore is capable of becoming a European prior right 
against EPF for novelty only.  (PCT-JU is not only prior art for novelty and 
inventive step against EPF because it was published after EPF’s priority date). 
- 
However, for PCT-JU to become such a prior art, it must be published in an 
official EPO language (i.e. English, French or German) and the filing fee must be 
paid, R165 EPC.  This can in practice only be achieved by validly entering the 
European regional phase.  The initial 31-month deadline expired in December 
2009. 
- 
The European regional phase can still be entered by fulfilling the acts of R159 
and paying the necessary further processing fees within 2 months of notification 
of the Communication of 4/1/10 deeming PCT-JU withdrawn, i.e. by  
 


 
- 5 - 

4/1/10 + 10 days → 14/1/10 (R126(2) EPC) 
14/1/10 + 2 months → 14/3/10, Sunday (R112(2) EPC) 
14/3/10 → Monday, 15/3/10 (R134(1) EPC) 
 
- 
In principle, KA could get an assignment executed that transfers the rights in 
PCT-JU fully to KA before entering the European regional phase.  However, in 
practice such an assignment only takes effect at the EPO only on production of 
appropriate evidence and after paying a fee (R22 EPC). 
- 
Thus, in practice it will be much more convenient to deal with this after regional 
phase entry has been effected. 
- 
As such, a professional representative (me) will be needed to complete the acts 
for late entry into the regional phase.  This is because JU are currently named as 
an Applicant and, as a legal person not having a principal place of business in a 
Contracting State, they are required to be represented in proceedings before the 
EPO as designated office after the initial 31 month period for entry into the 
national phase (A133(2) EPC, A27(7) PCT, How to get a European Patent Euro 
PCT Part 2, S309). 
- 
I can take the necessary steps myself without a separate authorisation. (R152 
EPC; Dec Pres Spec Ed 3 of OJ 2007, L1). 
- 
These steps are: 
(a) 
supplying a translation of the international application 
(b) 
specifying the documents on which the European grant procedure is to be 
based 
(c) 
paying the filing fee 
(d) 
paying the designation fee (assuming the ISR issued at least 6 months 
previously) 
(e) 
paying the supplementary search fee 
(f) 
filing a request for examination – including paying the examination fee 
(again assuming the ISR issued at least 6 months previously) 
(g) 
paying the renewal fee for the 3rd year. 
 
 
For items (a), (c), (d), (e) and (f), the further processing fees must also be paid 
(for (f) for both requesting examination and paying the examination fee).  For (g) 
an additional fee (50%) is payable because the due date has been missed.  As 
the 4th year renewal fee will be due soon (End of May 2010) it would also make 
sense to pay this now to avoid forgetting it later (we are within the 3-month 
allowable pre-payment period). 
- 
Once entry into the EP regional phase has been completed, the EPO will publish 
the translation of the application and the European prior right effect will come into 
existence. 
- 
Normally the publication takes about 6-12 weeks.  Unlike for direct European 
applications there is no direct provision allowing for early publication, but I would 
recommend filing, when completing the acts for entry into the regional phase, an 
informal request for prompt publication on the basis that it is relevant to an 
opposition on another European patent (see below).  Clearly, a careful watch 
should be in place to ensure publication occurs in good time. 
- 
Once PCT-JU’s translation has been published by the EPO, an opposition can be 
filed against EPF based on lack of novelty over PCT-JU as a European prior right.  
Unlike EP4, PCT-JU does specifically disclose in its description nets made of the 
specific material M and it is therefore novelty-destroying for EPF.  Note that the 
whole content of PCT-JU is relevant, not just the claims. 


 
- 6 - 

- 
The opposition deadline is 9/9/09 (date of publication of mention of grant of EP4) 
+ 9 months = 9/6/10 (A99(1) EPC). 
- 
PCT-JU is prejudicial to novelty for EPF for all states because EPF was filed after 
entry into force of EPC 2000 (see transitional provisions already discussed 
above). 
- 
Further, once EPF is revoked, its effect is void ab initio (A68 EPC), i.e. NF will not 
be required to pay any infringement costs. 
- 
Of course, NF could also use this ability to have EPF revoked as a bargaining tool 
for reaching an agreement with SF instead of pursuing revocation.  However, it 
would be prudent at least to ensure now that PCT-JU is validly regional-phased 
and available as a European prior right.  NF could then, if desired, negotiate with 
SF in advance of expiry of the opposition period, e.g. for (free) rights to use the 
subject-matter of EPF in their territory of interest (probably only NO) and 
withdrawal of the infringement suit in exchange for not getting EPF revoked.  This 
could have advantages for both sides: 
- 
SF would maintain their EPF patent and it would at least be more difficult 
for a third party to seek revocation throughout the national courts after 
expiry of the opposition period. 
- 
NF would be able to continue their activities, but EPF would block other 
parties from using this technology in the EP contracting states, including in 
NO (where EPF is validated, but which EP4 does not designate and where 
there could be problems national phasing PCT-JU – see below). 
- 
This puts NF in a strong negotiating position because SF clearly stand to 
lose most be not co-operating. 
- 
Should an agreement be reached, but relations deteriorate after the 
opposition period for EPF has expired, SF could still use the European 
regional-phased PCT-JU to attack EPF in national revocation actions (it 
appears action in just NO would suffice as both SF’s and NF’s activities 
are focussed there).  A national action in NO is also an option instead of an 
opposition even in the absence of any negotiations. 
 
4. 
 
- 
Probably not. 
- 
Although SF are Swedish, it appears that all of their activities are carried out in 
Norway (i.e. making and using the nets made of M). 
- 
Therefore, patent protection in NO will be needed in order to use patent rights 
against SF. 
 
EP4 
 
- 
EP4 was filed in May 2007 and so cannot have designated NO (which 
joined the EPC only on 1/1/08).  EP4 cannot therefore be used against SF 
in respect of their activities in NO. 
 
Other Applications? 
 
- 
There is no indication any national NO application was filed at the same 
time as filing EP4 and PCT-JU. 
- 
The 12 month period for filing a new application (e.g. a NO national 
application or an EP application filed after NO joined the EPC) claiming 
priority from EP4 and/or PCT-JU expired in May 2008. 


 
- 7 - 

- 
Therefore no further applications look possible. 
 
PCT-JU 
 
- 
PCT-JU designates NO (all states designated and NO is a PCT-contracting 
state). 
- 
However, it is not possible for the European regional phase application derived 
from PCT-JU to designate NO because NO was not an EPC-contracting state 
when PCT-JU was filed. 
- 
The only way protection could be obtained for NO would therefore have been by 
entering the NO national phase directly. 
- 
The time limit for entering the national phase in NO was 31 months from the 
priority date, May 2007 + 31m → December 2009. 
- 
The period has thus expired. 
- 
According to PCT Applicant’s Guide – NP Vol II – NO (referring to R49.6 PCT), 
the national fee for entering the NO national phase must be paid by the 31 month 
deadline.  If not paid, this can only be excused by re-establishment of rights 
requiring, inter alia, showing that the missed time limit was in spite of the 
Applicant taking “all due care” in the circumstances.  As failure to enter the NO 
national phase was presumably deliberate (JU having lost interest in PCT-JU) it 
seems unlikely that the conditions for re-establishment will be met. 
- 
It is therefore likely to be too late to obtain rights for NO from PCT-JU. 
- 
A specialist on NO patent practice should nonetheless be consulted as soon as 
possible to check whether any options still exist for reviving PCT-JU in Norway.
