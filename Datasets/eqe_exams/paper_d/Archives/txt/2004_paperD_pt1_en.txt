Question 1 
(5 points)  

 

On 12 February 2001, an applicant filed a European patent application EP which is today still 

pending. EP claimed priority from a GB patent application of 14 February 2000. On 29 January 

2004, the applicant filed a divisional application with the EPO.  

 

a) 
Which renewal fees have to be paid in 2004 for the divisional application? 

 

b) 
By when at the latest can you pay without an additional fee? 

 

c) 
By when at the latest can you pay with an additional fee? 

 

 

Question 2 
(4 points)  

 

On 23 September 2002, you filed on behalf of your client, company A, a European patent 

application EPFIRST as a first filing without claiming priority. Due to a favourable European 

search report, your client instructed you to file an international application PCTLATE claiming 

priority from EPFIRST and designating, among others, EP. In accordance with your client's 

instructions, you filed PCTLATE on 23 September 2003, having the same text as and claiming 

priority from EPFIRST. EPFIRST was withdrawn after all formal requirements for PCTLATE 

had been met. Today, 24 March 2004, the head of the legal department of company A informs 

you that, on 22 August 2002, company A had filed a German utility model application in the 

name of company A, disclosing and claiming the same invention of the same inventor as 

EPFIRST. The German utility model became publicly available in December 2002.  

 

Discuss the legal situation.

Question 3 
(2 points)  

 

A European patent was maintained in amended form after opposition proceedings by 

combining the subject-matter of granted claims 1 and 2. Only the sole opponent appealed the 

decision. May the patent proprietor reinstate the granted claim 1 during the appeal 

proceedings? 

 

 

 

Question 4 
(5 points)  

 

A Spanish company filed with the EPO an international application in Spanish on 

15 March 2004. The international application validly claims priority from a Spanish application 

filed on 21 March 2003. All necessary fees were paid to the EPO by an enclosed cheque. The 

Spanish company received a notification from the EPO that the application had been 

transmitted to the International Bureau. Why did the EPO transmit the application, what effect 

does this have, and what has to be done next? 

 

 

Question 5  
(4 points)  

 

A European patent attorney with his place of business in Paris filed on 12 February 2004, in 

Greek, a European patent application for a Greek applicant who lives in Paris. The priority of 

an earlier application filed on 13 February 2003 is validly claimed. All fees due have been paid.  

 

After filing, no further documents were filed relating to the European patent application.  

 

a) 
What is the legal situation today, 24 March 2004? 

 

b) 
What can be done to obtain protection of the invention by means of a European patent 

 application?

Question 6 
(5 points)  

 

A European patent application EP1 was filed on 1 October 2001. EPO form 1001 indicated that 

it was intended to pay the designation fees for Austria, Belgium, Spain, Germany and the 

Netherlands only. 

 

The filing fee and the search fee were duly paid. On 2 April 2003, the European Patent Bulletin 

mentioned the publication of the search report which indicates that EP1 comprises three 

inventions. Designation fees were only paid for Austria, Belgium, Spain and Germany. These 

designation fees were paid on 2 October 2003. 

 

Two European divisional applications EP2 and EP3 were filed from the parent application, both 

designating Austria, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. EP2 was filed on 12 August 2003, 

and EP3 was filed on 12 November 2003. All fees were duly paid.  

 

Which Contracting States could be validly designated in EP1, EP2 and EP3? 

 

 

Question 7 
(5 points)  

 

You are representing Mr. A who has filed a European patent application. In a communication 

C1 pursuant to Article 96(2) and Rule 51(2) EPC, dated 24 June 2003, you were invited to file 

observations and amendments to the application within a period of four months. On 

28 October 2003 you requested a two month extension of this period. The request was granted. 

On 18 December 2003, you requested a further extension of one month, because due to the 

applicant's Christmas holidays you would not have the information necessary to reply to the 

communication in due time. This further request was rejected in a communication C2 dated 

8 January 2004. The ensuing loss of rights was noted in a communication C3 dated 22 January 

2004.

a) 
What is the legal status of the application today, 24 March 2004, and what would you do 

to save the application?  

 

b) 
Would an appeal against the rejection dated 8 January 2004 be admissible?  

 

c) 
Can you have the finding as to the loss of rights reviewed by a Board of Appeal?  

 

 

Question 8 
(3 points)  

 

You are representing the applicant of an international application. The EPO, acting as 

International Searching Authority (ISA) considered that the application contained 18 inventions, 

despite the fact that there was only one independent claim, without alternatives formulated 

therein. The independent claim was followed by a number of dependent claims.  

 

Thus, you have received an invitation to pay additional search fees for 17 inventions. Your 

client considers that he has made only one invention and strictly refuses to pay any additional 

search fee. Nevertheless, he asks you to file a demand for International preliminary 

examination for this international application.  

 

a) 
Under these circumstances, is it possible to have the finding of the ISA as to the number 

of inventions reviewed under the provisions of the PCT?  

 

b) 
How will the non-payment of the additional search fees affect the further prosecution of 

the PCT application in the International phase?

Question 9 
(3 points)  

 

An International application PCT 1 designating EP and directed to process P was filed by 

Professor A without claiming priority. One week before the filing date, Professor A had orally 

disclosed the whole process P during his lecture held at a public congress at his university. A 

compendium of all lectures held at the congress, including a written version identical to 

Professor A's lecture and indicating the date on which it was held, was made available to the 

public one month after the filing date. The oral disclosure and the compendium are cited in the 

International search report pertaining to PCT 1.  

 

Will the EPO consider Professor A's oral disclosure part of the prior art for the purposes of 

novelty and inventive step 

 

a) 
as International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) during International preliminary 

examination of PCT 1?  

 

b) 
after entry into the European phase during substantive examination of PCT 1?  

 

Question 10 
(5 points)  

 

Your client from Switzerland has invented a new gardening tool. Your client presented the tool 

for the first time to the public from 24 to 30 September 2003 at the IGA 2003 international 

gardening exhibition, which took place from 25 April to 12 October 2003 in Rostock (DE).  

 

Your client has a certificate issued at the exhibition by the authority responsible for the 

protection of industrial property at that exhibition, stating that the gardening tool was in fact 

exhibited there, the opening date of the exhibition and the date of the first disclosure, as well 

as an identification of the gardening tool duly authenticated by the mentioned authority.

2004/DI/e/6 
 

Today, 24 March 2004, your client wants to file a Swiss national application CH-1 as a first filing, 

describing and claiming the gardening tool. Since your client is interested in having the tool 

protected in all Contracting States of the EPC, he intends to file a corresponding European 

patent application EP-1 a few days before expiry of the priority year in 2005, claiming priority 

from CH-1 and designating all Contracting States. 

 

Would you recommend your client to proceed as planned, and what steps would you propose 

to take?  

 

 

Question 11 
(4 points)  

 

A European patent application was filed by company A. On 4 September 2003 a 

communication pursuant to Rule 69(1) EPC was issued informing the applicant that the 

application was deemed to be withdrawn under Article 96(3) EPC. 

 

The European patent application was transferred to company B on 22 October 2003. A request 

for recording the transfer of the European patent application accompanied by a declaration of 

transfer signed by both companies A and B was filed, and the applicable administrative fee paid, 

on 27 November 2003. 

 

On 14 November 2003, company B filed a request for further processing, paid the further 

processing fee, and completed the omitted act. 

 

Was the request for further processing validly filed?
