Part I: Legal Questions 
 

QUESTION 1 
(9 MARKS) 

Applicant A filed a European patent application EP-A with independent claims 1 and 3, 

and claim 2 dependent on claim 1. A communication according to Rule 71(3) EPC was 

issued today for EP-A as filed. Company B has validly instituted proceedings against 

applicant A before the competent national court of a EPC contracting state to seek a 

decision adjudging that Company B is entitled to the grant of EP-A.  

 

Company B wants: 

 

(a) 
EP-A to proceed to grant with one claim combining original claims 1 and 2 after the 

competent court has issued a final decision that Company B is entitled to the grant 

of EP-A; and 

(b) 
claim 3 to be prosecuted in a separate European patent application. 

 

How should Company B proceed before the EPO?

QUESTION 2 
(7 MARKS) 

Your client’s competitor X filed international application PCT-X in English without 

claiming priority at the EPO as receiving Office on 13 April 2017. PCT-X comprises 

independent claim 1 relating to product A and dependent claim 2 relating to product A 

combined with feature B.  

 

Your client is of the opinion that claim 2 lacks clarity. Your client also found a document 

making product A available to the public before the filing date of PCT-X. 

 

Which procedural actions can you take while the competitor’s application is pending: 

 

(a) 
during the international phase? 

(b) 
after PCT-X has entered the regional phase before the EPO?

QUESTION 3 
(9 MARKS) 

Last month applicant C filed on the last day of the priority period application X at the 

EPO claiming priority from his earlier German patent application DE1. DE1 describes 

capsules made from aluminium, and claims capsules made from aluminium and 

capsules made from metal. The description of application X is identical to the description 

of DE1. Applicant C intended to file a set of claims identical to the claims of DE1.  

Today, 26 February 2019, he realizes that he forgot to file any claims at all for X. 

 

Between the priority date and the filing date, an article disclosing capsules made from 

aluminium and capsules made from metal was published. 

 

Can applicant C still get protection for capsules made from aluminium and capsules 

made from metal, and what should C do if: 

 

(a) 
application X is a PCT application filed using request form PCT/RO/101?  

(b) 
application X is a European patent application?

QUESTION 4 
(7 MARKS) 

Your client Mr X has instructed you to file an opposition against European patent EP1 

granted to his competitor Y. The mention of the grant was published on 30 May 2018. 

The sole claim of EP1 is directed to a device A. EP1 was filed on 16 June 2016 and 

claims priority from Korean patent application KR1 filed by Y on 30 June 2015. KR1 is 

written in Korean. 

 

Mr X has only found as prior art a Canadian patent application CA1 also filed by 

competitor Y on 14 May 2014 and published on 19 November 2015. CA1 discloses the 

same device A. 

 

(a) 
Is the opposition against EP1 likely to succeed? 

(b) 
Will a translation of KR1 into an official language of the EPO be required during 

the opposition proceedings?

QUESTION 5 
(8 MARKS) 

PCT-X was duly filed with the EPO as PCT receiving Office. PCT-X contains two 

separate inventions. Upon filing you indicated on request form PCT/RO/101 that the 

EPO was chosen as International Searching Authority (ISA), and filed an automatic debit 

order.  

 

You have received an invitation to pay one additional search fee dated 25 January 2019 

from the EPO acting as ISA indicating that the requirements of unity of invention are not 

complied with.  

 

You received an email today, 26 February 2019, informing you that the deposit account 

did not contain sufficient funds.  

 

What will the international search report and written opinion of the ISA cover in the 

following situations? 

 

(a) 
You replenish the account up to the amount of one additional search fee today. 

(b) 
You gave, on 14 February 2019, an order to a banking establishment in a 

contracting state to transfer an amount of EUR 10 000 to the deposit account.

Part II: Legal Opinion 
 
 
Today, 26 February 2019, you receive a letter from Ms Fast: 

 

Dear Attorney, 

 

[001] I own the German shoe manufacturer FASTER (F), where I design and 

manufacture running shoes. My main markets are Germany and Austria, and my only 

factory is located in Germany. According to common general knowledge, shoe soles (S) 

are made of polymer foam. Nanoparticles (NP) are particles of less than 100 

nanometers (nm) which have gained huge interest in the scientific world. This inspired 

me to experiment with shoe soles comprising nanoparticles in the polymer foam. 

 

[002] During my research, I found out that all metal nanoparticles modify the foam 

structure of a shoe sole, thereby improving energy storage of the shoe sole. Such shoe 

soles return energy to the runner. In particular, I found out that copper nanoparticles up 

to 40 nm increase energy storage of shoe soles by 200% compared to soles without 

nanoparticles. Copper is a metal. On 19 January 2018 I filed at the EPO, in the name of 

FASTER and without claiming priority, the European patent application EP-F1 in 

German. EP-F1 describes the effect of increased energy storage, and claims a shoe 

sole comprising copper nanoparticles up to 40 nm.

2019/D/EN/7

[003] Afterwards, I found out that all metal nanoparticles increase energy storage of 

shoe soles by 40% compared to soles without nanoparticles. If the size of the metal 

nanoparticles is up to 80 nm, energy storage will be increased by 100%, and if the sole 

comprises copper nanoparticles up to 80 nm, energy storage will be increased by 150%. 

I therefore filed the European patent application EP-F2 at the EPO on 25 February 2018. 

I filed EP-F2 in German in the name of FASTER, and paid the filing fee and the search 

fee for EP-F2. EP-F2 contains the entire disclosure of EP-F1, and claims priority from 

EP-F1. EP-F2 describes the effect of increased energy storage, and describes and 

claims a shoe sole comprising metal nanoparticles (claim 1). EP-F2 also describes and 

claims a shoe sole comprising metal nanoparticles up to 80 nm (claim 2).  

Further, EP-F2 describes and claims a shoe sole comprising copper nanoparticles  

up to 80 nm (claim 3).  

 

[004] In my most recent development, the shoe soles comprise silica nanoparticles in 

the range of from 35 to 45 nm (sole A). Silica is not a metal. Silica nanoparticles within 

that size range increase energy storage of the shoe soles by 300% compared to soles 

without nanoparticles. Such soles will give runners a significant advantage! I spent the 

last months with preparations for mass production of these soles. I want to start selling 

shoes with sole A in April 2019, but have not yet publicly announced anything.

[005] My Austrian competitor HIKE (H) is also active in the field of running shoes. HIKE's 

only factory is located in Austria. Last week, I performed a search on the Internet and 

found an announcement which was published on HIKE's website on 30 January 2019 

(announcement A). This announcement stated that HIKE would start selling shoes with 

shoe soles comprising silica nanoparticles in the range of from 35 to 45 nm in 

April 2019. What a shock! These shoe soles have exactly the same composition as our 

sole A! After some investigations in my company, my - now former - employee Mr 

Furious finally admitted in a written statement that he was angry for not getting a 

promotion, and therefore had sold information on the composition of sole A to HIKE  

on 24 December 2018. 

In announcement A, HIKE also states that these shoe soles are protected by HIKE's 

Austrian patent AT-H. I found out that AT-H was filed on 4 October 2015, published in 

April 2017, and that the mention of the grant of AT-H was published in January 2018. 

AT-H is in force, and describes and claims a shoe sole comprising nanoparticles. AT-H 

neither specifies the material nor the size of the nanoparticles, and also does not 

mention the effect of increased energy storage. 

 

[006] During my Internet search, I also found another announcement on HIKE's website, 

published on 21 February 2018 (announcement B). In that announcement, HIKE stated 

that they had bought the European patent application EP-H, and that the transfer was 

registered with the EPO. HIKE further stated that they will soon produce and sell shoe 

soles comprising copper particles of from 70 to 80 nm (sole B), and that these soles are 

protected by their patent application EP-H.  

As said, I also experimented with copper nanoparticles, and there is no doubt that 

copper particles of from 70 to 80 nm can be mixed into any polymer foam in order to 

produce sole B. I have realized that the manufacturing process becomes simple and 

cheap when the shoe soles have the composition of sole B. I am therefore very keen on 

manufacturing and selling shoes with sole B!

[007] EP-H was filed at the EPO in Chinese by the Chinese company LONG RUN on 

18 August 2016. EP-H was published in English on 21 February 2018, and was granted 

without amendments. The mention of the grant of EP-H was published on 

16 January 2019. The granted patent EP-H describes and claims a shoe sole 

comprising copper particles of from 70 to 80 nm. The only material described in EP-H is 

copper. I had the original Chinese text of the European patent application EP-H 

translated by a certified translator. The translator alerted me that the English publication 

of EP-H differs from the Chinese text, even though this is not obvious from the English 

text. The Chinese text of the patent application only mentions copper particles of from  

70 to 80 micrometers (μm), and it does not mention nanometers at all. 

One micrometer (μm) equals 1000 nanometers (nm). 

 

[008] By the way, I also filed a European patent application EP-F3 at the EPO in 

German in the name of FASTER on 2 February 2018 without claiming priority. The 

description of EP-F3 states that the addition of metal nanoparticles in the range of from 

35 to 80 nm increases energy storage of shoe soles, and that any metal can be used. 

EP-F3 claims a shoe sole comprising metal nanoparticles in the range of from 35 to 

80 nm. I intentionally never paid any fees for EP-F1 and for EP-F3 due to the intended 

filing of EP-F2. I received a notification of loss of rights for EP-F1 in June 2018, and a 

notification of loss of rights for EP-F3 in July 2018.

I am very upset about the announcements on HIKE's website, and therefore urgently 

need your advice! Please advise me on the following issues: 

 

1. Outline the patent situation as it currently stands for the claims of FASTER's 

applications  

 

(a) EP-F2 

(b) EP-F1 

(c) EP-F3. 

 

 

2. As the situation currently stands, are FASTER or HIKE free to produce or sell the 

following products in Austria or Germany 

 

(a) shoes with sole A, 

(b) shoes with sole B? 

 

 

3. How can you improve the situation for FASTER?
