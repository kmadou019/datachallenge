Dear Mrs. Patent Attorney, 

 

[0001] We are a medium-sized manufacturer of products for the treatment of water, said 

products comprising membranes. Our main production facilities are located in Vienna, 

Austria, and from there we export our products to emerging countries, where the market 

for water treatment is rapidly growing. 

 

[0002] For the filtering out of fine solid particles present in waste water, modules are 

known that comprise a bundle B of hollow fibre membranes, i.e. hollow tubular fibres 

whose walls act as a membrane. These modules are adapted to be connected, via a 

holder for holding the fibres, to a pump in order to draw water from the outside into the 

interior of the hollow fibre membranes. The membranes are usually made of ceramics of 

class C, but may also be made of a special class of polymers P. These modules are 

adapted to be immersed in waste water but suffer from the problem of incrustation with 

particles if the waste water surrounding the modules does not flow, but stagnates. In 

order to obviate this problem we have developed a membrane module that can be 

immersed in stagnant waste water. Our module comprises, in addition to the known 

bundle B of hollow fibre membranes, a specially designed nozzle N that is adapted to 

inject air bubbles into the bundle B, thereby removing incrustations on the fibres which 

decreases the frequency of cleaning and prolonging the life time of the module.

[0003] On 31 July 2009 we filed a European patent application EP-1 without claims. Its 

description comprises a general part and a part describing a single embodiment and 

referring to the drawings. The general part discloses a module comprising a bundle B of 

hollow fibre membranes and the specially designed nozzle N for injecting air into the 

bundle B in order to remove incrustations on the fibre bundle. It is stated in this part that 

the membranes and the nozzle N may be made of any suitable material and in particular 

that the membranes may be made of ceramics of class C and the nozzle N may be 

made of stainless steel. The part describing the embodiment and referring to the 

drawings discloses a module comprising bundle B of hollow fibre membranes made of 

ceramics of class C and the specially designed nozzle N made of stainless steel. It is 

stated that it is essential for this embodiment that the specially designed nozzle N is 

made of stainless steel and that the membranes are made of ceramics of class C. It is 

further stated that this provides a reliable module having a prolonged life as the nozzle 

can be readily immersed in waste water without corroding. EP-1 was subsequently 

abandoned. 

 

[0004] On 3 May 2010 we filed a PCT application PCT-1 containing the same 

description as EP-1. PCT-1 claims priority from EP-1 and contains a claim directed to a 

module comprising the specially designed nozzle N and a bundle B of hollow fibre 

membranes. The claim does not specify the material of the membranes and the material 

of the nozzle N. The purpose of filing PCT-1 was to obtain patent protection in emerging 

countries such as Brazil and India. PCT-1 was published in February 2011.

[0005] In June 2010, our research engineers tested other nozzles available on the 

market which are intended for aerating waste water. These nozzles are described in the 

Handbook of Waste Water Aeration published in December 2009, which states that they 

are suitable for injecting air into small interstices. The tests revealed that, although 

suitable for injecting air bubbles into the fibre bundle, these nozzles are not as effective 

as our specially designed nozzle N. As they are cheaper than our specially designed 

nozzle N, we nevertheless considered using them in our modules. In order to secure our 

rights in Europe, on 2 August 2010 we filed a European patent application EP-2 claiming 

priority from EP-1. To obtain the broadest patent protection possible, in the general part 

of the description of EP-2 we replaced the term “specially designed nozzle N” with the 

term “means for injecting air into the fibre bundle”. The part describing the embodiment 

shown in the drawings was left unchanged. Claim 1 of EP-2 is directed to a module 

comprising a bundle B of hollow fibre membranes and means for injecting air into the 

fibre bundle. Claim 1 does not specify the material of the membranes. Dependent 

claim 2 is directed to the module comprising bundle B of hollow fibre membranes made 

of ceramics of class C and the specially designed nozzle N made of stainless steel. 

 

[0006] The search reports of EP-2 and PCT-1 did not reveal any relevant documents, 

but in the written opinion for PCT-1 an objection pursuant to Art. 6 PCT was raised. 

According to the examiner, it is essential that the hollow fibre membranes are made of 

ceramics of class C, but this feature is missing from the independent claim. The 

international search report for PCT-1 including the written opinion was transmitted on 

11 August 2011. EP-2 is still pending.

[0007] On 10 November 2011, we filed a demand for international preliminary 

examination of PCT-1 at the EPO and paid the corresponding fee. In our submissions 

accompanying the demand, we did not amend PCT-1, but rather explained why it is not 

essential that the hollow fibres are made of ceramics of class C. We included 

experimental data showing that our specially designed nozzle N also works with hollow 

fibres made of polymers of the class P. We also included an extensive description of our 

recently developed hollow fibre membranes that are made of polymers of the class P 

and are coated with a special coating K. We are convinced that these new hollow fibre 

membranes will revolutionise the hollow fibre membrane market as they are as stiff as 

ceramic membranes, but are less vulnerable to vibrations, in particular those generated 

by air bubbles injected into the bundle. Moreover, their production costs are very low 

compared to ceramic hollow fibre membranes. 

 

[0008] We have not received an international preliminary examination report (IPER) for 

PCT-1 yet. As we are interested in having a positive IPER, we have contacted the 

examiner at the EPO, who has agreed to give us a personal interview, tomorrow, at the 

EPO premises. PCT-1 has entered the national phases only in those emerging countries 

that we are interested in, which include Brazil and India. As we had also filed EP-2 and 

no objection concerning it was raised in the extended European search report, we did 

not enter the regional phase before the EPO for PCT-1.

[0009] Watergate Inc. from the US are our main competitor in the emerging countries 

and have their production sites in the US. As we knew that they had also been 

investigating how to solve the problem of incrustations in fibre bundle modules, we 

became concerned when we read a communication first posted on their website on 

30 July 2010 stating that they had filed a US patent application on 30 April 2010. The 

communication mentioned that the application relates to a hollow fibre membrane 

bundle module for waste water treatment comprising a nozzle for injecting air into the 

bundle for incrustation removal. Moreover, the communication stated that Watergate 

would soon also start manufacturing their products in Europe. We have since then also 

found out that on 2 May 2011 Watergate filed a European patent application EP-WG by 

reference to and claiming priority from US-WG filed on 30 April 2010. EP-WG and  

US-WG have been published. US-WG discloses a module comprising hollow fibre 

membranes made of polymers of class P, and a nozzle that is identical to our specially 

designed nozzle N and that is preferably made of stainless steel. Claim 1 of US-WG is 

directed to a module comprising a bundle B of hollow fibre membranes and the specially 

designed nozzle N. Claim 1 does not specify the material of the membranes and the 

material of the nozzle. Dependent claim 2 is directed to a module comprising the nozzle 

N and a bundle B of hollow fibre membranes made of polymers of class P.

[0010] We are presently manufacturing modules with specially designed nozzles N 

made of stainless steel and with hollow fibre membranes made of ceramics of class C. 

We are, however, also producing modules comprising the specially designed nozzle N 

made of other materials and hollow fibre membranes made of polymers of class P 

without the coating K. The latter modules are not as reliable as the first ones, but can be 

produced at much lower costs. We are also planning to manufacture and sell modules in 

which the specially designed nozzle N is replaced by the nozzles available on the 

market that are cheaper but less effective. 

 

Please advise us on the following questions: 

 

1) What is the legal status of our patent rights and those of Watergate?  

2) What do you advise us concerning our recently developed membranes 

 
comprising the special coating K? 

3) What can be done to improve our patent rights and what would be our 

 
resulting position vis-à-vis Watergate? 

 

[0011] We also need your advice on another urgent matter. Since 2008 we have been 

producing and selling filter cartridges comprising a different kind of membranes, known 

as Q-membranes, for the production of drinking water from sea water. Our  

Q-membranes are made of polymer Alpha and contain 4% of a compound R that is used 

to control the pore size of the membranes. Polymer Alpha has been used in the past for 

Q-membranes. We thought that it was commonly known in the art, at the latest by the 

end of 2005, to use compound R to control the pore size of membranes. In 2007, we 

carried out extensive tests that did not reveal any technical effect that would go beyond 

the expected pore size control. For these reasons we did not apply for patent protection 

for our Q-membranes or for the filter cartridges.

[0012] We were therefore very surprised when on 6 February 2012 Watergate instituted 

infringement proceedings against us before an Austrian court based on a European 

patent validated in Austria. This patent, EP-CART, was filed on 23 March 2006 without 

claiming priority. The single claim of EP-CART is directed to a Q-membrane made of 

polymer Alpha characterised by 1 to 5% of compound R. The subject-matter of the claim 

is directly and unambiguously derivable from the application as filed. The description 

states that the problem to be solved by the compound R is the control of the pore size. 

The search report cited only category A documents, among others document D1, 

published in 1999, which discloses a Q-membrane made of polymer Alpha. 

 

[0013] From a file inspection we have found out that Dialab GmbH, an Austrian 

company, had validly filed before the EPO an opposition against EP-CART on the sole 

ground that the subject-matter of the only claim extends beyond the content of the 

application as filed. It appears from the file that the opposition division rejected the 

opposition in a decision announced during oral proceedings held on 2 December 2011 

followed by a written reasoned decision dated 27 February 2012. We believe that the 

decision is correct. 

 

[0014] Triggered by the infringement proceedings, we consulted our copy of the 

Encyclopaedia of Membrane Technologies, a standard handbook in the field of 

membrane technology. The encyclopaedia was published on 23 March 2006 and 

teaches that it is common to use between 1 and 5% of compound R to control the 

pore size in membranes made of polymers.

[0015] By mere coincidence, our sales manager Franz S. recently met Wolfgang M., the 

sole owner of Dialab GmbH, at a cocktail party. According to Wolfgang, Dialab deals 

with analytics, i.e. analysing samples sent from hospitals and clinics. Dialab want to use 

a membrane covered by the claim of EP-CART for a new and promising analytics 

application. This is why they filed the opposition against EP-CART. Wolfgang is very 

upset by the decision of the opposition division and asked Franz whether Membrain and 

Dialab could work together to have the patent revoked. 

 

 4)  In view of the opposition and infringement proceedings, what are the  

 
 
options and corresponding actions to be taken before the EPO? 

 

Yours sincerely
