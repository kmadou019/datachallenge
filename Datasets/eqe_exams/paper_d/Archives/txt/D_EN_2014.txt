Part I : Legal Questions 

 

QUESTION 1 
(6 MARKS) 

 

In January 2013, Mr Baum, who has his residence in Germany, filed the European 

patent application EP1 for subject-matter A without claiming priority. EP1 was withdrawn 

in May 2013. In July 2013 subject-matter A was disclosed in a scientific article.  

Your client Ms Mele, who has her residence in Italy, recently learned about the filing of 

EP1. Ms Mele informed you that she can prove that Mr Baum has stolen her invention 

and that in fact she is entitled to the grant of a patent for subject-matter A. Ms Mele 

wants to have patent protection for subject-matter A through the EPO. 

a) 
Which steps must she take? 

b) 
In which contracting states can she obtain protection?

QUESTION 2 
(7 MARKS) 

 

Applicant X filed an Italian patent application IT1 disclosing and claiming only subject-

matter A. No priority was claimed. Then applicant X filed an Italian patent application IT2 

with an independent claim 1 directed to subject-matter A and a dependent claim 2 

directed to subject-matter A+B without claiming priority. 

IT1 was accorded the filing date of 3 December 2012 and IT2 was accorded the filing 

date of 4 December 2012. At a symposium on 7 December 2012 filing of IT1 and IT2 

was mentioned and their content was disclosed. 

On 10 December 2012 applicant X withdrew IT1. On 3 December 2013 applicant X filed a 

European patent application EP1 with claims identical to IT2 and claiming priority of IT2. 

 
Can a patent be granted for EP1 with claims 1 and 2?

QUESTION 3 
(8 MARKS) 

 

European patent application EPX was filed using Form 1001 on 16 February 2012 

without claiming priority. On 21 August 2013 the publication of the European search 

report was mentioned in the European Patent Bulletin. Due to legal incapacity of the 

representative, the proceedings before the EPO were interrupted as from 

20 November 2013 and were resumed on 20 January 2014 after a new representative 

had been appointed. 

Today, the newly appointed representative realises that a reply to the opinion 

accompanying the search report had been duly filed but that the examination fee has  

not yet been paid. The applicant would prefer to pay the examination fee not before 

April 2014.  

 
What should the new representative advise concerning the payment of the examination 

fee?

QUESTION 5 
(6 MARKS) 

 
The applicant filed a European patent application containing an independent claim 1 and 

a dependent claim 2. During oral proceedings the examining division pointed out that the 

subject-matter of claim 1 lacked inventive step. However, the division indicated that 

claim 2 would fulfil the requirements of the EPC. The applicant nevertheless did not 

amend the claims. The application was refused by a decision dated 6 August 2013. 

On 1 October 2013 the applicant filed a notice of appeal. On 4 October 2013 he paid the 

fee for appeal and requested reimbursement of that fee. On 28 November 2013 the 

applicant filed a statement of grounds of appeal together with a new single claim 

consisting of the features of previous claims 1 and 2. 

Today the applicant seeks your advice. He has the following questions: 

 
a) 
Is the appeal admissible? 

 
b) 
Will the examining division review its decision and reimburse the fee?

Part II : Legal Opinion 

 

[001] I am the CEO of cosmetics company Gray Dorian (GD), situated in the Czech 

Republic. We are involved in the development and production of cosmetic products.  

Our patent matters are handled by one of our employees who is our patent manager and 

who also represents our company before the EPO. 

[002] We have recently developed a new anti-ageing cream. This cream contains as an 

active ingredient a compound which belongs to the family of compounds known as (K). 

This family contains four different compounds in total, i.e. compounds A, B, C and D. 

These compounds and their anti-ageing properties were first reported in the 1980’s. 

However there are no commercial products comprising said compounds because they 

decompose when incorporated into standard creams, which results in unstable 

compositions. 

[003] One of our competitors, Crème de la crème (CLC), based in France, is involved in 

the production of cosmetics and chemical products. They have found a solution to the 

stability problem mentioned above by incorporating the further ingredient X into a 

standard cream composition comprising compounds of family (K). Ingredient X is known 

in the prior art as a solubiliser (increases the solubility of other compounds), however its 

effect on the stability of compounds of family (K) is admittedly unexpected.



[004] On 26 March 2011 CLC filed European patent application EPFR1 by reference to 

and claiming priority from their French patent application FR1 filed on 23 April 2010. 

According to EPFR1, X increases the stability of the compounds of family (K) in cream 

compositions. EPFR1 specifically discloses such cream compositions containing any 

one of compounds B, C, and D. EPFR1 also contains one claim directed to a cream 

composition comprising X and a compound belonging to family (K). 

[005] EPFR1 was published in September 2011 with its search report which cites no 

relevant documents. EPFR1 was granted in autumn 2012 and today is in force in various 

countries including France and the Czech Republic. 

[006] In our development work we tried to develop a cream containing compound A. 

Although A is the most active compound in the family (K), it is also the most unstable. 

Our tests showed that the incorporation of X into a cream containing A increases its 

stability. We also discovered that the incorporation of an ingredient Y (known from the 

prior art but not as a stabiliser) in addition to X enhances the stability of the composition 

to a surprising extent. Thus, on 16 April 2012 we filed a Czech patent application CZ1 

which describes the surprising stability of the cream compositions comprising A, X and 

Y. CZ1 does not mention family (K) or any of the other compounds of said family. CZ1 

contains a single claim directed to a cream composition comprising A, X and Y. CZ1 was 

withdrawn shortly after its filing.





[007] After we filed CZ1 we continued our development work and we realised that the 

stabilisation effect of the combination of X and Y was also exhibited by cream 

compositions comprising any one of the other compounds of the family (K). On 

10 August 2012 we filed European patent application EPCZ1 in English, claiming priority 

from CZ1. EPCZ1 contains the description of CZ1 and further discloses cream 

compositions that contain any one of compounds B, C or D (in combination with X and Y) 

and examples of these compositions. EPCZ1 contains an independent claim directed to a 

cream composition comprising any one of compounds A, B, C or D in combination with X 

and Y. EPCZ1 also contains a dependent claim directed to a cream composition 

comprising A, X and Y. The only fees that we have paid for EPCZ1 are the filing and the 

search fees. 

[008] In May 2013 we sent the priority document to the EPO. On 18 December 2013 the 

EPO published the European search report, which cited document EPFR2, an application 

belonging to CLC. The European search report was accompanied by a search opinion and 

an invitation to file a translation of the priority document into one of the EPO official 

languages. We have received no other communication from the EPO relating to this issue. 

[009] Our intention is to introduce a cream composition containing compound A as well as 

X and Y into the European market in the near future. Later on we would like to launch 

products containing the other compounds of family (K). 

[010] However, two weeks ago we received a letter from CLC inviting us to a meeting next 

month to discuss the patent situation of the cream compositions that contain a compound 

of family (K). CLC mentions in their letter that they have become aware that we are 

planning to introduce into the market a cream composition comprising compound A. CLC 

also mentions that they believe that such a cream composition would infringe their patent 

rights originating from a patent application and two patents.



[011] The patent application in question is the European patent application EPFR2, 

mentioned above, which was filed on 5 May 2012 without claiming any priority. The 

application is directed to a cream composition comprising A in combination with X, Y and a 

further known ingredient W. According to the description, said composition exhibits greater 

stability than the compositions disclosed in EPFR1. The description does not contain any 

reference to family (K) or to any one of compounds B, C or D. EPFR2 contains a single 

claim directed to a cream composition comprising A, X, Y and W. The application was 

published on 6 November 2013 without a search report. 

[012] We have noticed that the stability of the composition disclosed in EPFR2 is not as 

good as that of our composition disclosed in EPCZ1. 

[013] The first of the two patents referred to in CLC’s letter is EPFR1, mentioned above. 

[014] The second is European patent EPFR3. EPFR3 was filed in 2003, granted in 2008 

and is currently in force in various countries including the Czech Republic. The patent 

contains a single claim directed to a process for the production of compound Z. CLC uses 

Z as a starting material in a multi-step process for the production of A. Compound Z does 

not have any anti-ageing properties. 

[015] We obtain compound A from Indian company Bollychem (BC). We contacted BC 

last week. They told us that they use Z in their process for the production of A and that 

they produce Z according to the process of EPFR3. They have also informed us that they 

are free to use this process in India since there is no Indian patent that corresponds to 

EPFR3. In addition, they have informed us that it is not possible for them to modify their 

process for the production of either Z or A.



 
[016] In principle we would prefer to keep BC as our supplier since they provide us with 

compound A of high quality containing no major impurities and no trace of Z. 

[017] Until last year, we had a department for chemical synthesis and we had even 

developed a new process for the production of compounds A, B, C and D which does not 

employ compound Z. This process is far more efficient than the one which employs Z.  

[018] We had even initiated the procedure for obtaining patent protection for our new 

process. Thus, on 7 March 2011 we filed the Czech application CZ2 and on 

12 September 2011 we filed the PCT application PCTCZ2 in English. PCTCZ2 claims 

priority from CZ2. CZ2 was withdrawn shortly after filing. The search report of PCTCZ2 

was published on 17 January 2013, citing no relevant documents. The accompanying 

international preliminary report on patentability for PCTCZ2 was therefore positive. 

Unfortunately, last year we closed down our chemical synthesis department due to 

financial difficulties. Therefore, we decided not to enter any national or regional phase with 

PCTCZ2. 

[019] When we received the letter from CLC, I asked our patent manager about PCTCZ2. 

He told me that it is too late to initiate the European phase of the application PCTCZ2. 

He also informed me that we have not received any communications from the EPO 

relating to this issue.

[020] The relationship between our company and CLC has traditionally been good and we 

have successfully collaborated with them on a number of occasions. We would prefer to 

find an amicable solution in the present situation if possible. 

Please analyse the situation and provide us with your professional advice.  

Specifically, please advise: 

 

1) 
What is the current situation with regard to the applications/patents relating to the 

cream compositions? What actions should we take in the next four months? 

2) 
In view of CLC’s rights, should we continue obtaining compound A from our Indian 

supplier? 

3) 
Can we obtain a European patent for our new process for the production of 

compounds A, B, C and D? 

4) 
During the meeting with CLC, what proposals should we make to them and why?
