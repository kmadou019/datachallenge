QUESTION 1
    (14 MARKS)

On 5 January 2024, applicant D filed international application PCT-3 at the Spanish Patent 

and Trademark Office (SPTO) acting as receiving office. The PCT request indicates the EPO

as International Searching Authority (ISA). The filing fee, search fee and transmittal fee have

been duly paid.

In a notification dated 17 January 2024, the SPTO invited applicant D to furnish a 

translation.

(a) In which language was PCT-3 filed and what steps does applicant D have to take for the 

ISA to start the search?

(b) Applicant D wants to file amended claims and correct an obvious mistake in the 

description at the lowest possible cost during the international phase. In what language, when

and where do the respective documents have to be filed?


QUESTION 2
   (12 MARKS)

In November 2021, company C filed European patent application EP-2. Only the filing and 

search fees were paid.

The publication of the European search report, which was accompanied by a negative 

search opinion, was mentioned in European Patent Bulletin of 17 May 2023.

On 26 May 2023, the EPO issued a communication pursuant to Rule 69 EPC and an 

invitation pursuant to Rule 70a(1) EPC.

No further acts were performed by company C. Due to an isolated mistake within a normally 

satisfactory monitoring system, company C became aware only today of a communication 

from the EPO dated 12 December 2023 noting that there has been a loss of rights.

Is it still possible for company C to prosecute EP-2? If so, what steps have to be taken and 

by when?
