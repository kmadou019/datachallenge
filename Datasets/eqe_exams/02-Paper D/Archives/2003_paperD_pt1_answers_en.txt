Q1 
 
Decision was deemed received on 16.12.2002, Rule 78(2) EPC and Article 119 EPC. 
 
Article 108 EPC sets period of 2M from date of notification of decision to file appeal in 
writing and payment of fee (R fees. 2, Item 11). So deadline for filing notice of appeal 
expired16.02.03 (Sunday), therefore extended to 17.02.03 (R 85(1) EPC). No further 
processing (A 121 EPC possible). 
 
A refusal of application by Examining Division is an appealable decision (Article 106(1) 
EPC). 
 
Applicant can make restitutio application (A 122 EPC) of 2M time limit but needs to file 
request in writing within 2M of removal of non-compliance and within 1Y of missed time 
limit; pay fee; show all due care (may be difficult here, representative should have 
known about appeal period?). 
 
Omission of reason for decision is substantial procedural error (R 67), but not sure about 
communication of possibility of appeal being anything more than a courtesy service 
which in view of J 1/89 cannot be relied on J 2/87 - refusal of patent is void if due to an 
erroneous EPO communication (good faith). Not clear from the question if this is 
erroneous communication - possibly in which case J 2/87 may apply. 
 
Q2 
 
EPI 
27.12.02 
fees and translation  
Rule 51(4) 

 
02.01.03 

 
(a) R 25(1) EPC, applicant may file divisional application for any pending European 
patent application. Application is pending up to but not including date of mention of grant 
being published under A 97(4) EPC (OJ 2002, 112), C-VI 15.5. 
 
Combination of R 51(4) + R 51(6) communications (OJ 2001, 488) intended to shorter 
period between despatch of R 51(4) communication and grant to about 8 months. 

 

02.01.03 such a short time after R 51(4) acts completed that application will not yet have 
granted so can file divisional application. 
 
Q2(b) 
 
EP2 
23.04.03 - to be published. 

 
R 25(1) EPC - any pending application can be file up to but not including date of mention 
of grant being published under A 97(4) EPC (OJ 2002, 112), C-VI 15.5, ie 22.04.03 is 
last possible date. File divisional directly at EPO in Munich or The Hague (A 76(1) EPC).

Q2(c) 
 
No - there is no pending application as required by R 25(1) EPC on which divisional may 
be based. 
 
Opposition proceedings only relate to granted patents (A 99(1) EPC). 
 
Q3 
 
R 60(2) EPC/A 114 EPC is not applicable to appeal proceedings in opposition because 
of the different legal nature of the proceedings (G 7/91). So withdrawal of appeal by 
opponent as sole appellant terminates appeal proceedings (G 7/91). Termination of 
appeal occurs irrespective of whether patent satisfies requirements of EPC (G 8/93). 
 
Intervention under A 105 EPC is admissible if filed during pending appeal proceedings 
(G 1/94). But if filing of intervention and filing of sole appellant’s notice of withdrawal of 
appeal take place on same day then their chronological order must be taken into 
account (T 517/97). Withdrawal of an appeal has immediate effect and is not postponed 
to midnight on date of filing (T 517/97) - T 517/97 also related to filing by fax and in view 
of this, in Q3 A 105 EPC intervention wouldn’t be admissible (fees for opposition and 
appeal would be refunded). [Doesn’t matter when confirmation of fax was received]. 
 
Q4 
 
Notice of opposition needed to be filed within 9M of publication of grant of patent 
(A 99(1) EPC) ie by 19.03.03 (Wednesday). Fee for opposition (RFee 2, item 10 = 610 
Euro) was also due that day. 
 
Notice of opposition was sent in time (14.03.03). Fax filing allowed (OJ 1992, 299) and R 
36(5) EPC. EPO may request written confirmation of fax and probably good idea to send 
this anyway. Fee arrived late (20.03.03) by 1 day and was insufficient amount 
(122 Euros too little) but this is OK because of RFees 12(1) - 20% reduction in 
opposition fee ie 20% of required amount, R 6(3) EPC for A 14(2) EPC situation. 
 
RFees 8(3) provides that will be considered filed in time if an order was given to a 
banking establishment within the period set (ie before 19.03.03, which it was) and a 10% 
surcharge was paid (or is within 10 days of expiry of period for payment). Didn’t pay 
surcharge - so under Rule 8 fees 8(4) EPO will ask for surcharge and evidence of 
transfer to bank establishment in time → pay this: 
 
Language
 
Spanish opponent (by nationality) so A 14(4) EPC applies (as opposition must be filed 
by time limit) - opposition can be filed in Spanish so is OK. But must file translation 
within 1M of filing document (R 6(2) EPC, A - VIII, 2.1) or else is deemed not received 
(A 14(5) EPC). So have until 14.04.03 to file translation into English, French or German 
under R 6(2) EPC. As opposition was filed by fax, subsequent copy must be sent in 
same language as fax and then copy is deemed received on date of filing fax  
(A - IX, 2.5).

Representative 
 
Spanish client was allowed to filed notice of opposition due to A 133(1) EPC as is 
resident of a Contracting State. For me to be his representative will likely need to file 
authorisation under R 101 EPC (OJ 1991, 489) as has been change of representative 
(before first act done on behalf of client). 
 
Q5 
 
priority date 28.08.00. 
 
31 M period (R 107(1) EPC) expires 28.03.03 (Friday). 
 
Enter EP regional phase by 28.03.03 using Form 1200, pay national basic fee 
(R 107(1)(c) EPC), pay designation fees R 107(1)(d) EPC, (as A 79(2) EPC) period will 
already have expired and international search report takes place of EP search report (A 
157(1) EPC), pay search fee (R 107(1)(e) EPC, A 157(2)(b) EPC) as search fee will 
need to be drawn up - get 20% reduction in supplementary search report if JPO did ISR 
(OJ 1979, 368); file request for examination (A 94 EPC, R 107(1)(f) EPC) and pay 3rd 
year renewal fee (R 107(1)(g) EPC). 
 
R 107(1)(a) EPC requires translation of PCT application to be furnished to EPO as 
required by A 158(1) EPC. But not ready to file this yet (don’t want to incur urgency 
charges etc. by getting spec translated here into Japan by Friday) so enter European 
regional phase (by doing all things noted above by 28.03.03) without filing translation of 
application. R 108(3) EPC provides grace period of 2 M after notification to furnish 
translation, on payment of surcharge (RFees 2.3(c)) - although will end up paying 
surcharge this is likely to be much less than urgency charges for translation costs. 
Therefore have at least 2 months for client’s translation department to do this. 
 
Not necessary to file Japanese priority document (OJ 1999, 80, Dec. of Pres and A - III, 
6.7) as EPO will put this in file automatically, R 38(4) EPC. Will need eventually to file 
translation of this (or declaration that priority doc ≡ application as filed) by end of Rule 
51(4) EPC period. 
 
Q6 
 
Mr A. died, Rule 60(2) EPC indicates Mr H. can become party to opposition proceedings 
but that Opposition Division may continue proceedings of its own motion without the 
participation of heirs. However Guidelines D-VII, 6.2 says that this provision will also 
apply where only one opposition has been filed (as is the case here). Effectively Mr H. 
has been transferred Mr A’s business and assets of interest in which opposition was 
filed, so pending opposition has also been transferred (G4/88).  
 
Opposition is limited by extent indicated in notice of opposition, that have been properly 
submitted and substantiated in the notice of opposition (G 10/91, G 9/91): So can’t 
extend opposition to cover method of producing P at this stage.

Q7 
 
A 135(1)(b) EPC allows the national office of a Contracting State to apply procedure for 
grant of a national patent at the request of the applicant/proprietor in certain 
circumstances, where provided by national law. 
 
For Portugal, (see Nat Law Table VII, cols. 1 and 5 (pg 103)) European patent applicant 
can’t be converted into a Portuguese patent application for the reason of refusal by EPO 
(only for deemed withdrawal, A 77(5) EPC; deemed withdrawal due to A 90(3) EPC 
because translation in language of proceedings under A 14(2) not filed in time). But can 
convert EP application that has been refused into a Portuguese application for a utility 
model (see col. 5) - could well be worthwhile doing that here. 
 
Conversion to national utility model also has lower inventive step requirements, so might 
be allowable - needs checking. 
 
Take steps of requesting conversion within 3 M of refusal of application (A 135(2) EPC) 
and then take steps referred to in cols. 2 + 3 on pg 103 Nat Law Table VII - will not need 
to appoint authorised representative if applicant has place of business/residence in 
Portugal. 
 
Q8 
 
must apply for new appln within 3 months of decision becoming final (A 61(1) EPC) ie by 
11.05.03. 
 
(a) 
(i) Can file new EP patent application (A 61(1)(b) EPC). Rule 15 EPC sets out 
rules for filing new application, and A 61(2) EPC provides that provisions of A 
76(1) EPC also apply to the new application. A 76(1) EPC does not allow subject 
matter of new application to extend beyond the content of the earlier application 
as filed (and A - IV, 1.3.3 and A - VIII, 1.3 are relevant). So client would not be 
allowed to include further embodiments as this would extend beyond application 
as filed contrary to A 61(2) EPC in conjunction with A 76(1) EPC. 

 
 
(ii) No in view of R 37(4) EPC (which expressly refers to Article 61(1)(b) EPC 
and says no fees due in respect of year in which new application is filed and any 
preceding year. 

 
(b) 
Yes still entitled to file new European patent application even if original 
application A is not pending at time new application is filed (G 3/92). → in fact 
the only thing client can do in these circumstances is to file a new application (G 
3/92) ie can’t do either A 61(1)(a) or (c) alternatives.

Q9 
 
R 17(2)(a)(i) declaration means that EPO as ISA has told applicant and IB that no 
international search report will be established as the ISA considers the application to 
relate to subject matter which the ISA is not required or decides not to search. 
 
(a) 
No refund of search fee will be made by EPO, EPC or PCT. PCT only provides 
for refund of search fee where due to reasons of national security, the PCT 
application isn’t treated as such (R 16.2 PCT) or if PCT application is withdrawn 
before the transmittal of the search copy to the ISA. EPO also refund 100% of 
search fee where PCT appln is withdrawn or considered withdrawn under Art 
14(1), (3) or (4) PCT before the start of the international search or if the ISA is 
based wholly or partly on an earlier search (100% and 50% respectively), 
OJ 2002, 56, in line with R 16.3 and R 41.1 PCT. But no provisions for 
reimbursement of search fee in this case. 

 
(b) 
Entry into the national phase is not affected by R 17(2)(a)(i) PCT declaration (A 
22(2) PCT). However, a designated state may consider unsearched parts (ie the 
only claim in this case) to be withdrawn unless the applicant pays a special fee 
to the national office of that state (A 17(3)(b) PCT). 

 

On entry into European regional phase, a European (supplementary) search 
report will not be established as claim relates to a method of treatment (A 52(4) 
EPC) as the subject matter is excluded from patentability, R 45 EPC. 
 
Suggest filing amended claims on entry into European regional phase, which 
may have likelihood of being searched under A 92(1) EPC (will be given 
opportunity to do this under R 109 EPC + R 110 EPC). 
 
As implant itself is new and revolutionary, file claim (product claim) to implant. 
Appears to have support in description and claim amendment won’t add matter 
over application as filed, in accordance with A 123(2) EPC and G 2/98. 
 
G 2/88 - change of claim category allowed if no extension of protection. 
 

Q10 
 
Thailand is not a Paris Convention country (see OJ 2002, 216). 
 
Thailand is a WTO country (see OJ 2002, 226). 
 
Article 8(2)(a) PCT and R 4.10(a) PCT provide that an application in or for any country 
party to the Paris Convention of the WTO can be basis of priority claim for a PCT 
application. So, a PCT application can validly claim the Thailand priority. BUT 
R 4.10(d) PCT provides that where a designated office has laws incompatible with R 
4.10(a) and (b) PCT, those paragraphs do not apply to those states for as long as the 
incompatibility exists provided the office informs the IB as required under R 4.10(d) PCT. 
The EPO and the JPO have informed the EPO of this incompatibility. So at present, for 
EPO and Japan, may not be able to sustain priority claim to the Thai application. 
 
However, for EPO this question has now been referred to the Enlarged Board of Appeal, 
G 2/02 and G 3/02.
