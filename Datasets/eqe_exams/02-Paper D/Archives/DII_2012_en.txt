Candidate’s answer 
 
Q1.  
 
Membrain AG (aka MAG) 
 
EP-1 
 Filed = 31/7/09. 
 No priority date, so effective date = 31/7/09. 
 Filed without claims, but claims not required for European filing date. 
 Hence, a valid filing date was probably obtained. 
 First application for the Modules comprising: 
o bundle B of hollow fibers; 
o nozzle N. 
 N can be any suitable material, B can be class of ceramics C. 
 Specific embodiment links N = stainless steel with C = class of ceramics. 
 Subsequently abandoned, e.g. lack of claims. 
 Too long ago to save, so only priority rights exist since the fate of a ‘first 
application’ does not dictate priority rights unless abandoned explicitly without 
any rights outstanding (not the case here). 
 
PCT-1 
 Filed = 3/5/2010. 
 Claims priority from EP-1. 
 
Priority:-  

 Priority is valid because: 
o Same applicant (MAG) 
o Same invention 
 PCT-1 and EP-1 have same description; 
 Claim of PCT-1 is the general part of description of EP-1 (and PCT-
1). 
 EP-1 is ‘for’ PC states, so valid first application 
o PCT-1 was filed within the priority period 
o Effective date of PCT-1 is 31/7/09 
Nb. Priority period of EP-1 ‘ended’ 31/7/10, but this was a Saturday, so period 
extends to Monday 2/8/2010. 
 
Patentability:- 
 


- 2 - 

 PCT-1 first MAG application to claim module with nozzle N and bundle of 
hollow fibres B. 
 Claims are novel and inventive because there is no prior art 
 
Status:- 
 Validly entered Brazil/India nat. phases. 
 So, patent rights will ensue in these countries. 
 Time limit for entering EP phase = 31m from priority i.e. 
 
 
31/7/09 + 31m = 29/2/12 
 
 So, EP entry time limit missed. 
 However, this can be remedied (see Q. 3) 
 US entry also missed (31/1/12). 
 
EP-2 
 Filed 2/8/10 
 Priority claimed from EP-1 
 Priority is partially valid because: 
o Same applicant, EP-1 is a valid first application etc. (as for PCT-1), AND 
o EP-2 filed in priority period which ended on 2/8/10 (calculated above for 
PCT-1). 
 However, not all of EP-2 is unambiguously derivable from EP-1 because N in 
general part of EP-1 broadened in general part of EP-2. 
 In fact, N broadened to ‘means’ which covers items other than nozzles! 
 Hence EP-2 has too effective dates: 
o Claim 1 (no priority):  effective date = 2/8/10 
o Claim 2 (priority):  
effective date = 31/7/09 
 Specific embodiment including drawing also entitled to priority. 
 
Patentability:-  
 Claim 2, effective date = 31/7/09 
o No prior art, so claims are probably novel and inventive 
o Claim 1, effective date = 2/8/09, 
 Would be anticipated by PCT-1 if it enters EP phase (A. 54(3) 
EPC). 
 Claim 1 of EP-2 also lacks novelty over EP-WG because EP-WG 
has earlier (valid!) priority date (A. 54(3) EPC). 
 WG website publication of 30/7/10 also anticipates Claim 1 but 
not Claim 2.

Status:- 
 So, Claim 2 can give rise to EP-wide protection for module comprising: 
o bundle B wherein fibres = C; and 
o nozzle is special nozzle N made from stainless steel. 
 EP-2 can still be amended because it is still pending. 
 
Watergate (WG) 
 
US-WG 
 
 Filed 30/4/10. 
 No priority, so effective date is 30/4/10. 
 No prior art to US-WG (EP-1 not published at effective date). 
 Seems to be nothing stopping WG obtaining exclusive rights to US for: 
o Module with bundle B and nozzle N (Claim 1); and 
o Module with N and B, wherein B is polymers P (Claim 2). 
 
EP-WG 
 
 Filed 02/5/11 
 Claims priority from US-WG 
 
Priority:-  
 Priority claim is valid because: 
o Same applicant (WG or inventors for US) 
o US is a PC state 

o EP-WG filed by reference to US-WG, so same invention 
o and EP-WG filed within priority year of US-WG. 
 
Nb. US-WG priority period ‘ends’ 30/4/11 which is a Saturday and so extended to 
Monday 2/5/11. 
 
 So effective date of EP-WG is 30/4/11. 
 
Patentability:- 
 Claim 2 of EP-2 is A. 54(3) art to EP-WG 
 Claim 1 of EP-2 is not A. 54(3) art because it does not have priority so effective 
date is 02/8/10. 
 Claim 2 of EP-2 anticipates Claim 1 of EP-WG because it discloses Modules 
with B = C, and N. 


- 4 - 

 Claim 2 of EP-WG is novel over Claim 2 of EP-2 because it relates to a module 
in which B = P. 
 
Summary 
 EP-1 is irrevocably abandoned so no protection ensues. 
 PCT-1 gives exclusive rights to MAG in Brazil and India for module with B (any 
material) and N (any material). 
 EP-2 has two claims: 
o Claim 1 = anticipated by EP-WG, WG website 
o Claim 2 = will give EP patent for module with B (ceramic C) and N 
(stainless steel). 
 US-WG gives exclusive US rights to WG for Module with B (any material) and 
N (any material). 
 EP-WG can give a patent to Module with N (any material) and B (polymers P). 
 
Q2. 
 
 The special coating K was disclosed to EPO as IPEA on 10/11/11 as part of 
request for international preliminary examination. 
 This information included experimental data and an ‘extensive description’ so it 
is probably an enabling disclosure. 
 PCT-1 was published February 2011, so its file was publicly accessible on 
10/11/11. 
 IPEA files are confidential until IPER has been established, at which point EPO 
will grant access (Nb. For purpose of A. 128(4) EPC, international publication 
has effect of EP publication). 
 Since the IPER has not yet been issued, your submission of 10/11/11 is not yet 
publicly available. 
 
Advice: 
 It is of paramount importance that you file a patent application as soon as 
possible. 
 At the latest, the patent application should be filed before IPER is finished (and 
hence publicly available) because publication of your comment would bee 
novelty-destroying prior art. 
 The Examiner should, if asked, tell you the IPER timeframe in your telephone 
interview tomorrow.  This will give you an idea of the deadline for filing. 
 Since you already have an experimental report and extensive description of 
modules/bundles with K, the new application should take little time to prepare.

 In terms of what application to file, I recommend a PCT application with 
simultaneous US application. 
 Filing a PCT application allows you to cover many of your target emerging 
countries (e.g. Brazil, India) at the same time. 
 A PCT application will also protect your manufacturing facilities in AT. 
 PCT also allows you to delay much of the costs. 
 A competent rO would be AT, EPO or IB. 
 Filing PCT also allows you to cover the USA which enables you to prevent WG 
from competing.  You must prescribe the inventor as applicant for the US. 
 Nonetheless, I still suggest filing a US application because this will have an 
earlier prior right effect than a US-PCT.  This would help to invalidate a US 
application potentially filed by WG in the future. 
 Potential claims for the future US-PCT applications could include: 
o Coating K 
o Use of K in water filters 
o Module comprising: 
 N nozzle  
 B made of P coated with K 
o Fibres of P coated with K 
 
Q3. 
 
Your commercial products include: 
 
(A)  Modules with N (stainless steel wherein the fibres are C. 
(B)  Modules with N (various materials) wherein the fibres are P coated with K. 
(C)  Modules with means other than N. 
 
 EP protection is key because your manufacturing facilities are in AT. 
 Good to have protection in US to prevent competition from WG. 
 Also important to have protection in emerging countries e.g. Brazil/India. 
 
Actions 
 PCT-1 has very broad protection and no prior art, but 30/31m NP entry 
deadlines expired 31/1/12 and 29/2/12 respectively. 
 Investigate whether NP/RP entry is still possible in states of interest e.g. US. 
 This depends on local law. 
 For EP, entry is still possible. 
 EP will have been designated on filing PCT-1, so the failure to enter EP phase 
will elicit a communication deeming loss of rights in EP (R. 160(2) EPC).

 You can use this to get an appealable decision. 
 Whilst appeals against formal rejections are successful, this is an expensive 
strategy. 
 A more economical alternative is to invoke further processing for the various 
acts required for EP entry. 
 Thus, by 30/4/12 (i.e. 33m from priority), you should: 
o Request further processing for each omitted act 
o Conduct each omitted act 
o Pay further processing fee for each act (50% of each missed fee; €225 
for each of the other omitted act). 
 The omitted acts are: 
o Pay the filing fee (including any excess page/claim fees) 
o Request examination  
o Pay examination fee 
o Pay first renewal fee 
Nb: EPO was ISA, so no need for search fee 
o No translation required 
o No representative required since you are an Austrian applicant. 
 If successful, this can lead to a EP patent covering Modules with B (any 
material) and N (any material).  Since there is no prior art to PCT-1, request 
PACE to secure quick allowance in EP. 
 You can therefore stop WG from selling/manufacturing in EP. 
 However for your product  (A), WG has a right to prevent you using fibres = C.  
So, you may need to take a licence. 
 Euro-PCT-1 puts you in a very strong position to negotiate, but it is not clear 
what WG will want.  You could consider cross-licencing to allow WG to operate 
in Brazil/India. 
 Filing application covering use of K (i.e. Q. 2 above) will give you exclusive 
rights to this invention, but EP-WG cover modules with the polymer P. 
 WG can therefore stop you manufacturing your commercial product (B).  This 
could be resolved using a cross-licence i.e.  
o WG licences the polymer B in EP 
o You licence WG the coating K in USA. 
 For commercial product (C), nobody seems to have any rights to the 
alternatives to nozzle N, so rights will be dictated by who owns rights to e.g. 
o Coating K (you) 
o Ceramic C fibres (you) 
o Polymers P (WG)

Q4. 
 
 Dialab GmbH (hereafter DGB) are not active in the field of seawater filtration. 
 Hence, DGH are not a competitor to MAG, so you should accept Wolfgang’s 
offer to cooperate. 
 Dialab are not allowed to transfer their status as opponent, so they must 
remain a party to EPO opposition appeal proceedings. 
 Dialab should file an appeal against the decision to keep the proceedings 
open. 
 To do this, DGH should: 
o File notice of appeal by: 27/2/2012 + 10d =  08/3/12 
 
 
 
 
 
       + 2m = 08/5/2012 
o File grounds of appeal by: 27/2/2012 +  10d + 4m 
 
 
 
 
 
 
= 08/7/2012 (Sunday) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
= 08/8/2012 (Monday) 
 DGH Opposition limited to A. 100(c) EPC. 
 DGH can only raise fresh grounds with consent of WG, they are unlikely to 
accept this!  
 MAG should file an intervention (allowable during pending appeal proceedings 
G 1/94)  
 To do this MAG should: 
o File a reasoned statement 
o Pay opposition fee 
o Prove that infringement proceedings have been started against MAG 
 
 This should be done by: 
o  
Date of start of proceedings + 3m = 6/2/12 + 3m 
 
 
 
 
       = 6/5/12 (Sunday) 
 
 
 
 
       = 7/5/12. 
 In the intervention, MAG should raise attack of lack of inventive step based on 
a combination of the ‘A’ document cited in the ESR regarding Q-membrane 
made of polymer alpha the prior knowledge of using R to control pore size in 
polymers. 
 The raising of a new ground of opposition by an intervener during appeal will 
result in the case being remitted to the opposition division (G 1-94). 
 In terms of evidence regarding the prior knowledge of R to control pore size, I 
suggest: 
o File signed affidavit of your scientists and offer them as witnesses; 
o Try to find prior publication of this knowledge; 
o File the relevant pages of the encyclopaedia 


- 8 - 

 The encyclopaedia is not part of the state of the art against EP-CART since it 
was published on the filing date of EP-CART. 
 However, the encyclopaedia is permissible evidence of common general 
knowledge before the filing date (T 890/02) 
 Furthermore, file your evidence obtained in your laboratories that 4% R merely 
controls pore size and no other technical effect. 
 4% R falls within the claim, meaning that WG could not allege any further 
technical effect exists across the full scope of the claim. 
 With this evidence, the claim of EP-CART clearly lacks inventive step over: 
o ‘A’ doc teaches Q with alpha 
o Problem is controlling pore size 
o This is common general knowledge since encyclopaedia evidences that 
cgk was that 1-5% R controls pore size in membranes of polymers. 
 
 This will revoke EP-CART and terminate infringement proceedings against 
MAG. 
 For completeness, it is noted that DGH must not withdraw appeal before case 
is remitted to opposition division since: 
o Intervener is only a party of right in appeal; and 
o Withdrawal of sole appeal (DGH) terminates appeal proceedings.
