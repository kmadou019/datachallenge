Today is 1 March 2011. 

You receive the following letter from the director of Axbruch GmbH, a manufacturer of 

bicycle components, based in Germany:  

 

 

We are a globally active supplier of bicycle components. Our major competitor is 

Pankutaya Japan K.K., a conglomerate with manufacturing and research facilities in 

Japan and the Netherlands.  

I am responsible for patenting, but I find this work rather difficult. I have had to represent 

the company in an opposition, which has not gone well and which is now at the appeal 

stage. I will come back to this later, because there is another matter I would like your 

advice on first. It concerns our new product, which is aimed at the European market for 

bicycles.  

In 2009, we worked on the development of a new type of axle unit. Such a unit is 

screwed into a bicycle frame by the bicycle manufacturer. It includes an axle and 

bearings. The pedals of the bicycle are connected to the ends of the axle via cranks. 

This type of axle unit is normally filled with a lubricating composition before it is sealed.  

For our axle unit, we developed a special seal (S). This special seal S allows the use of 

a larger diameter axle, which is stiffer. This special seal S also allows us to use a new 

type of axle of which the diameter decreases towards each end. Unlike the other axles 

on the market at the time, the ends of which had square cross-sections, we developed 

two new variants of axle ends. The first variant has a pentagonal cross-section. The 

second variant has a cross-shaped cross-section. The latter shape is a radical departure 

from the normal square shape.  


Page 2 of 7 

2011/DII/EN/2 

Both variants of the unit were developed by Alice and Bob, two of our designers, who 

were part of our early-stage development team based in Germany. We filed a German 

patent application DE-Ax on 30 October 2009, with an independent claim to an axle unit 

with the special seal S. Both variants of the axle are fully described. As far as the 

lubricating composition is concerned, we included in DE-Ax a long list of different types 

of suitable oils, including silicone oil. We indicated that the chosen oil could be combined 

with at least one additive, such as an antioxidant, a detergent, a corrosion inhibitor or a 

viscosity index improver. All are known components for forming a lubricating 

composition. DE-Ax is deemed withdrawn for failure to pay the filing fee. 

As we prepared for market introduction, Alice relocated to the United States, to head up 

the testing and prototyping of our new axle units. At this stage of the product 

development process, she was surprised to discover that a lubricant composition 

consisting specifically of a combination of silicone oil and any viscosity index improver 

ensures that the special seal S continues to function for longer. Other compositions lead 

to leaks of the lubricant past the special seal S at an early stage, thereby limiting the 

lifespan of the axle unit. For that reason, at the conclusion of the design phase, we had 

settled on two variants of our axle unit, each filled with silicone oil and a viscosity index 

improver, and including the special seal S and an axle with decreasing diameter towards 

axle ends having either a pentagonal or a cross-shaped cross-sectional shape.  

On 1 February 2010, we submitted detailed specifications of our two axle units as well 

as of the preferred lubricant composition to a standardisation committee for bicycle 

components. This information was sent on the same day to the members of the 

committee for their opinion, prior to a meeting of the committee. Most major suppliers to 

the bicycle industry are in the committee, which has been set up to ensure that, when 

new components are introduced, suppliers of other components have interoperable 

components available for consumers and producers of bicycles.

2011/DII/EN/3 

As a precaution, our developers have been instructed to file a copy of what is submitted 

to the standardisation committee as a U.S. provisional patent application. In this case, 

such an application, hereafter referred to as USP-Ax, was filed by Alice on the same day 

(1 February 2010), naming herself and Bob as applicants and inventors. At the same 

time, she filed a declaration of assignment, signed by Bob and Alice, of USP-Ax to 

Axbruch GmbH. Ten months later, and in accordance with our normal procedure, Alice 

notified me of what she had filed, so that I could judge whether we should file further 

patent applications.  

In this case, I did nothing, because there had not been any changes to the axle unit as 

already fully disclosed in an international patent application PCT-Ax. I filed this 

application with the EPO on 2 November 2010, in the name of Axbruch GmbH, naming 

Alice and Bob as inventors. PCT-Ax claims priority from DE-Ax.  

Claim 1 of PCT-Ax is an independent claim to an axle unit with the special seal S and a 

lubricant composition comprising a combination of silicone oil and a viscosity index 

improver. Claim 2 is dependent on claim 1, and additionally specifies that the axle 

decreases in diameter towards its ends. Claim 3 is dependent on claim 2, and specifies 

the pentagonal cross-section of the axle ends, whereas claim 4 is dependent on claim 2 

and specifies the cross-shaped cross-section of the axle ends. The description and 

drawings of PCT-Ax were based on those of DE-Ax, but limited to axle units with a 

lubricant composition which is a combination of silicone oil and a viscosity index 

improver. We also added the results of our tests.  

We have received an invitation to pay a further search fee in respect of the subject-

matter of claim 4, dated 23 January 2011 and accompanied by a partial international 

search report citing JPU-PAN1. JPU-PAN1 is a Japanese utility model with a filing date 

of 15 July 2009 which was published on 21 October 2009. EP-PAN1, an application filed 

on 1 July 2010 by reference to JPU-PAN1, claiming priority from JPU-PAN1 and 

published early in January 2011 is cited as evidence of the contents of JPU-PAN1.

2011/DII/EN/4 

EP-PAN1 and JPU-PAN1 were both filed in the name of Pankutaya Japan K.K.’s Dutch 

subsidiary, Pankutaya Nederland B.V.. EP-PAN1 claims and discloses an axle unit with 

a seal exactly the same as the seal S we had developed. The axle decreases in 

diameter towards each end. However, the axle of the only embodiment has end sections 

with a triangular cross-section. EP-PAN1 describes the lubricant as a silicone oil with a 

further additive that may be a viscosity index improver, an emulsifier or an anti-foaming 

agent. EP-PAN1 was assigned to Pankutaya Japan K.K. after filing. 

We were not that surprised by the partial search report, because Pankutaya had already 

reported to the standardisation committee in December 2010 the existence of  

JPU-PAN1, EP-PAN1 and JPU-PAN2. JPU-PAN2 is a second Japanese utility model 

application filed on 10 July 2009 and published on 10 October 2009. JPU-PAN2 was 

filed directly in the name of Pankutaya Japan K.K.  

JPU-PAN2 discloses an axle unit with a seal identical to our seal S and an axle 

decreasing in diameter towards each end. The axle has end sections that are 

pentagonal in cross-section. The description given in JPU-PAN2 states that the axle unit 

is filled with a lubricant composition consisting of a silicone oil and one of the following 

additives: a viscosity index improver, an emulsifier or an anti-foaming agent. We have 

established that there are no equivalents to JPU-PAN2 in other countries. We have 

considered whether to file third party observations in relation to EP-PAN1, citing  

JPU-PAN2, but we are not sure whether this is possible.  

The standardisation committee has very recently specified the cross-shaped axle end in 

a standard, because the members are convinced of its technical advantages over the 

pentagonal and the triangular axle ends. For example, other components of the bicycle 

that interact with the axle unit can be made lighter.

I sent off a debit order to the EPO for the further search fee immediately after receiving 

the invitation to pay the additional fee and told our accounts department to pay the 

amount of the fee into our deposit account. Unfortunately, I found out yesterday that a 

fax notifying us of a shortfall in the deposit account was received and passed straight to 

our accounts department on 26 January 2011. They have told me that our deposit 

account was replenished on 24 February 2011. It is our usual procedure to send faxes 

relating to the deposit account straight to our accounts department, but in this case I 

wish I had seen the fax, because it says something about an administrative fee to be 

paid.  

 

1) Please analyse our present position as far as patent protection in Europe for 

the various aspects of our developments is concerned. For which aspects of 

our developments can we obtain patent protection in Europe, and how? 

2) Please analyse whether Pankutaya could obtain valid patent protection that 

would pose a threat to our European activities. 

 

 

Now I come to the appeal. We were granted a European patent, EP-Ax, to a newly 

developed brake lever. We developed this brake lever for use in combination with either 

disc brakes or rim brakes. When we developed the brake lever, we had mechanical disc 

brakes and mechanical rim brakes in mind, in which the brake force generated with the 

brake lever is transmitted by steel cables to the disc or rim brakes. However, we thought 

at the time that the brake lever might also be suitable for use with hydraulic disc brakes 

or hydraulic rim brakes, in which the braking force is transmitted by hydraulic oil to the 

disc or rim brakes, but we did not get round to testing this possibility.  

 


Page 6 of 7 

2011/DII/EN/6 

The first claim of the granted patent was to the special brake lever, and there was also a 

claim to a bicycle brake system including at least one brake lever according to the first 

claim. The description of EP-Ax merely indicates that the brake lever is for use in a 

bicycle brake system of the type having at least one disc brake. However, there is no 

description or picture of any bicycle, nor is there any mention of rim brakes. 

Pankutaya opposed EP-Ax on grounds of lack of novelty on the basis of their earlier 

European patent application, EP-PAN2, which is state of the art under Art. 54 (3) EPC. It 

discloses and claims a bicycle with the same brake lever as ours and with hydraulic rim 

brakes. It includes a very detailed drawing of the brake lever. Therefore, in addition to 

our main request to reject the opposition, we filed an auxiliary request limiting the 

independent claim of EP-Ax to a bicycle brake system with the special brake lever, and 

with a disclaimer to disclaim bicycle brake systems in which the brake lever is used to 

actuate hydraulic brakes. EP-Ax was maintained by the Opposition Division in amended 

form in accordance with our auxiliary request.  

As a matter of fact, the bicycle described in EP-PAN2 was never put on the market. The 

reason for this is that it is impossible to make a functioning brake system with hydraulic 

rim brakes and the brake lever.  

We have not yet appealed the interlocutory decision of the Opposition Division, but the 

period for appeal has not yet expired. Pankutaya immediately appealed and also filed 

their statement of grounds of appeal. In the statement they only argue that the subject-

matter of the claim of EP-Ax is insufficiently disclosed because a functioning bicycle 

brake system fitted with the brake lever in combination with a hydraulic rim brake cannot 

be made. We accept that this is true. We have done our own tests and found that this 

problem does not affect brake systems using our brake lever in combination with 

mechanical rim or disk brakes or hydraulic disk brakes.

3) Should we appeal?  

4) Discuss what subject-matter we can validly claim to obtain the broadest scope 

of protection possible.
