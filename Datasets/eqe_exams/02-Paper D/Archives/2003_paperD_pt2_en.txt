You are a European patent attorney and today you receive the following letter from a 

new client, the Dutch company “PP” (for Plug & Pray), which you will represent in 

proceedings before the EPO. 

 

“We are a manufacturer of high voltage, high frequency (HVHF) plugs. Our only markets  

are Europe and the USA.  

 

Over the last three years our R&D department has been developing a new generation of 

HVHF plugs. Usually the contacts of these plugs have a circular cross-section. However 

our developers found out that the product life can be extended significantly by using 

contacts of triangular cross-section. 

 

On 01.03.2001, we filed a first patent application US1 with the USPTO, because the 

USA is the most important market for us and we are very sensitive with regard to patent 

infringement lawsuits. US1 describes and claims an HVHF plug with contacts of 

triangular cross-section.     

 

A few months later our developers discovered that contacts of square cross section also 

extend product life in comparison to traditional plugs. Accordingly, on 01.11.2001, we 

filed a further US patent application US2 as a continuation-in-part (CIP) of US1. US1 

was withdrawn shortly after the filing of US2. US2 describes and claims the same 

subject-matter as US1. In addition US2 describes and claims a plug with contacts of 

square cross-section. A US patent was granted in February 2003 for our US2 application 

as filed.

As we also need patent protection in Europe, we filed a European patent application 

EP1 with the EPO, designating all the contracting states and claiming priority of US2. 

We filed the following documents: description, claims, abstract, drawing, a designation of 

inventor, a declaration of priority and a certified copy of US2, as well as a cheque for the 

amount of the filing fee and the search fee. EP1 was mailed to the EPO by a regular 

registered letter on 29.10.2002 by national post services. The notice of receipt from the 

EPO indicates that the documents of EP1 were received by the EPO on 08.11.2002.  

 

EP1 describes and claims the same subject-matter as US2. In addition, EP1 describes 

and claims a plug with contacts of pentagonal cross-section, because in the meantime 

we found that such a pentagonal cross-section also extends product life. In fact our 

developers found that the surprising effect of having product life extended for HVHF 

plugs is achieved only if the plug contacts have a triangular, square or pentagonal cross-

section. We had a discussion on the unity of invention of EP1, but to us it was clear that 

the claimed three alternative solutions are in fact equivalent solutions to the same 

problem and are linked by the same inventive concept. Therefore we filed a single 

application for these three solutions. As we do not know yet which one of the three 

solutions is commercially the most promising, we would like to have patent protection for 

all the three solutions. Last month we started advertising our plugs with contacts of 

triangular or square cross-section. 

 

We thought we were in a good position, until last week, when we received a warning 

letter from our French competitor LBP (for “La Bonne Prise”). Therein they informed us 

that their European patent EP2 discloses and claims HVHF plugs with contacts of 

triangular or square cross-section. EP2 was granted for DE, ES, FR and GB.

LBP sells products in USA and in DE, ES, FR and GB. In the past LBP has only filed 

patent applications for these five countries. From the patent publication of EP2, which 

was attached to the warning letter, we could see that the mention of the grant of EP2 

was published on 06.11.2002. The letter further indicated that EP2 was granted without 

a prior publication of the application and that the short time between filing and grant was 

due to a request for accelerated prosecution. EP2 was filed on 14.11.2001 and claims 

priority of FR1, a French patent application of LBP with a filing date of 06.06.2001. We 

have made investigations and have found that FR1 only describes and claims plugs with 

contacts of triangular cross-section. 

 

In order to resolve the situation quickly, we have a meeting at the end of next week with 

LBP to discuss a possible settlement. 

 

We made some preparations for this meeting and we found that LBP filed another 

European patent application EP3. EP3 was filed without claiming any priority on 

15.03.2001. EP3 discloses and claims a shielding system for HVHF plugs. DE, ES, FR  

and GB were designated. The search report of EP3 was published on 24.09.2002 and 

contains only one reference, a German document, which is cited as an “A” document. 

We made a file inspection of EP3 and we found that a first communication had been 

issued in which it was indicated that grant would be possible if LBP were to amend the 

application in order to overcome certain clarity objections.  

 

Please note that we filed on 01.10.2000, together with our Spanish subsidiary as joint 

applicants, a Spanish patent application ES1, disclosing and claiming two shielding 

systems for HVHF plugs. One of these two shielding systems, S1, corresponds exactly 

to the one disclosed in EP3. The second shielding system, S2, is completely different. 

On 15.01.2003, the Spanish Patent Office granted a patent for ES1 without 

amendments.

…/…
 

At the end of the priority period, we were convinced of the commercial interest in S2, but 

we were sceptical concerning S1. Therefore, we filed on 01.10.2001, also as joint 

applicants, a PCT application PCT1 (in order to postpone costs) and a European patent 

application EP4, both claiming priority of ES1. EP4 describes and claims only S2, and 

PCT1 describes and claims only S1. The abstracts of EP4 and PCT1 have the same 

content as the abstract of ES1 which describes both shielding systems.  

 

We filed PCT1 in Spanish including all possible designations, and paid the filing, search 

and designation fees.  

 

On 10.04.2002 PCT1 and EP4 were each published with search report. Although the 

search report of PCT1 indicated that the claimed subject matter was clearly patentable, 

we decided that S2 was of more interest to us than S1. Therefore, we have not taken 

any action with respect to PCT1 after its filing.” 

 

 

1)  What is the patent situation with regard to the HVHF plugs ? 

 

2)  What is the patent situation with regard to the shielding systems ? 

 

3)  Give your analysis of the negotiation position of PP for the meeting with LBP 

next week. 

 

4)  If the meeting with LBP is not successful, what can be done by PP against 

LBP’s patent portfolio and what can PP do to improve its position?
