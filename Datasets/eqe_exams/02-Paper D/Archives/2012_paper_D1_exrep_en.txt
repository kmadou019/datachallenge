Examiners' Report Paper D 2012 - Part I 

As a positive trend it was noticed that more candidates cited the relevant legal basis with 
the necessary accuracy, which in the past has been a problem, especially for PCT-
questions. 
 
Candidates are reminded to accept the facts given in the paper and to limit themselves to 
these facts. See, for example, comments to question 6, last paragraph.  
 

1Question 1 

The majority of candidates recognized that the relevant date for calculating the period of 
appeal was 27 December 2011. However, not all of these candidates cited a T-decision 
relevant for the fact that a correction of the decision according to Rule 140 EPC has a 
retrospective effect. 
 
Some candidates did not realize that the concept of extension of periods according to Rule 
134(1) EPC is not applicable to the date on which the decision was deemed delivered in 
accordance with Rule 126(2) EPC. 
 
Other candidates thought that the reference to Article 56 EPC rather than Article 54 EPC 
implied a procedural violation and did not comment at all on the correction under Rule 140 
EPC. 
 
Few candidates recognized that reimbursement of the appeal fee is possible if the appeal 
is withdrawn in due time. 
 

2Question 2 

Some candidates did not realize when amended Rule 36 EPC entered into force and 
therefore did not differentiate between the requirements for DIV1 and DIV2. Few 
candidates were aware of the relevant transitional provisions, which apply to DIV2.  
 
Although only the filing requirements were asked for under item a), some candidates lost 
time by listing other requirements, like payment of various fees. 
 
A large number of candidates did not understand that the notification of the partial search 
report does not start the time limit for mandatory division according to Rule 36(1)(b) EPC. 
 

3Question 3 

Most candidates correctly referred to the supplementary international search and the 
corresponding provisions of the PCT. 
 
However, some candidates suggested entering into the regional phase before the EPO to 
have the second invention searched in the supplementary European search. Since the 
question states that your client wants a search to be carried out by the EPO before 
deciding on entry into the national/regional phase, such answers were not awarded any 
marks.  
 


- 2 - 

Not all candidates stated to which office the request should be submitted and by when the 
fees have to be paid. 
 
Very few candidates identified the Agreement under Article 16(3) PCT between the EPO 
and the WIPO as legal basis.  
 

4Question 4 

The question was generally answered well. 
 
With reference to Art. 150(2) EPC it must be taken into account that the priority claim is 
made under the PCT. However, the notion of "same invention" is to be interpreted in 
accordance with the case law for Article 87(1) EPC (see Art. 27(5) PCT). Nevertheless, 
candidates who answered the question by referring only to either Article 87 EPC or Art. 8 
PCT in conjunction with Art. 4 Paris Convention were still awarded the marks.  
 
Some candidates wrongly assumed that the later filing of the claims would result in a  
re-dating of EP-X according to Rule 56(2) EPC. This rule is only applicable if parts of the 
description or drawings are missing. 
 

5Question 5 

Most candidates referred to English and Chinese as languages of publication. For full 
marks all relevant elements of the contents of the publication had to be identified in detail.  
 

6Question 6 

Although the majority of candidates drew the correct conclusion, that it is too late to add a 
priority claim, a considerable number of candidates overlooked the possibility of requesting 
a correction under Rule 139 EPC. 
 
Some candidates allocated a single priority date to the whole application instead of 
distinguishing between the priorities for Inv1 and for Inv2. 
 
Even though the question did not give any facts supporting a request for re-establishment 
of rights in accordance with Article 122 EPC, some candidates lost time by speculating 
about this issue. 
 
Some candidates speculated that the priority of Inv2 is valid because it could be derived 
from Inv1, although there was no basis in the question for such speculation. 
 

7Question 7 

Most candidates referred to G1/07 and G1/04. However, not many correctly applied them 
to the facts of the question. 
 
A number of candidates missed the fact that the application had not yet been filed and 
suggested to insert a disclaimer into a claim.

8Question 8 

The majority of candidates recognized the crucial point that the improved subject-matter 
was made publicly available through file inspection. Some candidates wrongly concluded 
from the fact that the improved subject-matter in itself is sufficiently disclosed according to 
Article 83 EPC, that the amended claims meet the requirements of Article 123(2) EPC.

Possible solution - Paper D 2012 - Part I 

9Answer to question 1 

A correction of a mistake in a decision according to Rule 140 EPC has a retrospective 
effect, T116/90 or T212/88. The correction dated 24 January 2012 does not change the 
date of the decision dated 27 December 2011. 
 
The decision refusing the application was deemed delivered on 6 January 2012  
(27 December 2011 + 10 days, Rule 126(2) EPC). This is the starting date for calculating 
the time limit to appeal. In accordance with Article 108 EPC, notice of appeal shall be filed 
within 2 months of notification of the decision. Therefore, the period for filing the notice of 
appeal and paying the appeal fee expires today, 6 March 2012. It is advisable to file the 
notice of appeal and to pay the appeal fee today. 
 
Should your client decide not to proceed with the appeal, the appeal fee will be reimbursed 
in accordance with Rule 103(1)(b) EPC, provided that the appeal is withdrawn before filing 
the statement of grounds of appeal and before the period for filing that statement has 
expired. 
 
If your client decides to continue with the appeal, the statement of grounds of appeal has 
to be filed within 4 months from notification of the decision, Article 108 EPC. Since this 
period expires on Sunday, 6 May 2012, it is extended to Monday 7 May 2012, Rule 134 (1) 
EPC. 
 

10Answer to question 2 

a) Amended Rule 36(1) EPC entered into force on 1 April 2010. 
 
DIV1 was filed on 14 December 2009, i.e. before amended Rule 36 EPC entered into force. 
Hence, previous Rule 36(1) EPC applies, requiring only that the earlier application is 
pending. Moreover, according to Article 76(1) and Rule 36(2) EPC (as in force until 31 
March 2010), the divisional has to be filed in the language of the proceedings for EP1 with 
the EPO in Munich, The Hague or Berlin. Since DIV1 was filed in English with the EPO in 
Munich, and EP1 was still pending on 14 December 2009, all requirements were met. 
 
DIV2 was filed on 30 September 2010, i.e. after amended Rule 36 EPC entered into force. 
In accordance with amended Rule 36(1)(a) EPC, the applicant may file a divisional 
application before the expiry of 24 months from the examining division's first 
communication in respect of the earliest application (i.e. EP1). This time limit expired 
before 1 April 2010. According to the transitional provision applicable to amended Rule 
36(1) EPC (Article 3 of the Decision of the Administrative Council of 25 March 2009, OJ 
2009, 298 or 485) a divisional application of EP1 could still be filed until 1 October 2010. 
Moreover, according to Article 76(1) and amended Rule 36(2) EPC, the divisional has to 
be filed in the language of the proceedings for EP1 at the EPO in Munich, The Hague or 
Berlin. Since DIV2 was filed before 1 October 2010 in English with the EPO in Berlin, and 
EP1 was still pending on 30 September 2010, all requirements were met. 
 


- 5 - 

b) Since both EP1 and DIV2 are withdrawn and hence are no longer pending as required 
by Rule 36(1) EPC, it is not possible to validly file further divisional applications of EP1 or 
DIV2.  
 
For DIV1, the 24 month time limit set by amended Rule 36(1)(a) EPC has expired. 
Therefore, a divisional application cannot be filed unless the examining division issues a 
communication confirming the, or raising another, lack of unity objection, amended Rule 
36(1)(b) EPC.  
 

11Answer to question 3 

a) Yes, it is possible. Because the EPO was not ISA, the EPO is competent to carry out a 
supplementary international search, Article 3(4) of the Agreement between the EPO and 
WIPO (OJ 2010, 307) and Rule 45bis.9(a) and (b) PCT. 
 
b) A supplementary international search may be requested at any time prior to the 
expiration of 19 months from the priority date, Rule 45bis.1(a). This period expires on 5 
May 2012, extended under Rule 80.5 PCT to 7 May 2012.  
The request for a supplementary international search must be filed directly with the IB, 
Rule 45bis.1(b) PCT and should indicate that the EPO should act as SISA, Rule 
45bis.1(b)(ii) PCT. 
 
The international application was filed in Spanish. Since Spanish is not a language 
accepted by the EPO according to the Agreement between the EPO and WIPO, a 
translation of the international application in DE, FR or EN has to be filed together with the 
request, Rule 45bis.1(c)(i) PCT.  
 
It should be indicated in the request that the second invention should be searched, Rule 
45bis.1(d) PCT. 
 
The handling fee and the search fee have to be paid to the IB within 1 month from receipt 
of the request for the supplementary international search Rule 45bis.2 and Rule 45bis.3 
PCT.  
 

12Answer to question 4 

a) No, it is not possible. 
 
Product A1 is not disclosed in EP-X as filed. Thus, the claim directed to product A1 in 
PCT1 is not in respect of the "same invention" as EP-X, Article 87(1) EPC. Therefore a 
claim directed to A1 is not entitled to the priority date of EP-X, but has as effective date the 
filing date of PCT1. The document published in March 2010 is comprised in the state of 
the art within the meaning of Article 54(2) EPC. The claim directed to A1 is not new in view 
of the disclosure of this document. 
 
b) PCT1 was filed within the priority period, which expired on 20.12.2010, Article 8 PCT 
and Article 4 Paris Convention. If the draft paper had disclosed A1, then EP-X would have 
disclosed A1 and the priority claim would be valid. Therefore, the publication of March 
2010 would not be comprised in the state of the art within the meaning of Article 54(2) 
EPC and would not be novelty destroying. Thus patent protection could be obtained for the 
claim directed to product A1.

13Answer to question 5 

a) The international publication comprises a description, claims and drawings, if any (Rule 
48.2(a) ii-iv) PCT), a standardized front page (Rule 48.2 (a) i PCT) including the abstract 
(Rule 48.2(b) iii) PCT) and title, and the search report.  
 
Since the amendments and statement under Article 19 PCT were filed with the IB within 
the time limit of Rule 46.1 PCT, these will also be published, Rule 48.2(f), Rule 48.2(a)(vi) 
PCT. 
 
The description and claims (Rule 48.3(a) PCT), the amendments under Article 19 PCT 
(Rule 46.3 PCT) and the statement under Article 19 PCT (Rule 46.4 PCT) will be 
published in Chinese. The abstract, title and search report will be published in English and 
Chinese (Rule 48.3(c) PCT).  
 
b) According to Rule 86.1 (i) and 86.2(a) PCT a French translation of the abstract is 
published in the Gazette. This translation is available on the WIPO web site. 
 

14Answer to question 6 

For Inv1, EP1 validly claims priority from IT1, because EP1 was filed within the priority 
period and in respect of the same invention, Article 87(1) EPC. Therefore, document D is 
not part of the state of the art and protection can be obtained for Inv1. 
 
EP1 does not claim the priority of IT2 for Inv2. Thus, the effective date for Inv2 in EP1 is 
28 October 2011. This is after D was published. Therefore, at present D is comprised in 
the state of the art in accordance with Article 54(2) EPC, and destroys the novelty of Inv2 
in EP1. Hence, only with a valid claim to priority of IT2 protection for Inv2 in EP1 can be 
obtained. 
 
The insertion of a priority declaration under Rule 52(2) EPC is no longer possible because 
the 16-month time limit expired on 28 February 2012. Further processing is ruled out, Rule 
135(2) EPC. 
 
Filing a request for correction of the priority declaration under Rule 139 EPC, first sentence, 
is possible. Since EP1 has not been published yet and the preparations for publication 
have not been terminated yet, such a request has the potential to be granted (J3/91, J6/91 
or J9/91).  
 

15Answer to question 7 

According to G1/07 a method including a surgical step is excluded from patentability under 
Article 53(c) EPC. Thus, any method comprising (a) is excluded from patentability. 
 
Diagnostic methods carried out outside the human body, such as (b), are not excluded 
under Article 53(c) EPC, G1/04. Since the known method of biopsy (a) is not an essential 
feature of the method of diagnosing the illness, it can be omitted from a possible claim 
(Article 84 EPC). Thus (b) taken alone is patentable.

16Answer to question 8 

Since the subject-matter of the amended claims is new and inventive over the originally 
disclosed subject-matter, it extends beyond the content of the application as filed, contrary 
to Article 123(2) EPC. Therefore, the amended claims are not allowable. Thus, no 
protection for the improved subject-matter can be obtained via EP1. 
 
EP1 has been published. Therefore, the files relating to EP1 may be inspected according 
to Article 128(4) EPC. Since the amendments filed by the applicant in June 2011 are not 
excluded from file inspection by Rule 144 EPC, these were made available to the public as 
of June 2011, i.e. before the date of filing of EP2. These amendments are therefore 
comprised in the state of the art according to Art. 54(2) EPC and are novelty destroying for 
the improved subject-matter claimed in EP2. Thus, no protection for the improved subject-
matter can be obtained via EP2.
