1) 

a)  
A divisional application is deemed filed on the filing date of the patent application 

(A 76(1) EPC). Thus the deemed filing date of the divisional application is 12/2/01.  

 
Under A 86(1) EPC renewal fees are payable in respect of the third year and 

each subsequent year calculated from the filing of the application. Under R. 37(1) 

EPC renewal fees in respect of the coming year are to be paid on the last day of the 

month containing the anniversary of the date of filing. 

 
As the filing date of the divisional is 12/2/01 the patent years run as follows: 

year 1 
13/2/01 
→ 
12/2/02 

year 2 
13/2/02 
→ 
12/2/03 

year 3 
13/2/03 
→ 
12/2/04 

year 4 
13/2/04 
→ 
12/2/05 

year 5 
13/2/05 
→ 
12/2/06 

 

 
 
Under R. 37(3) EPC, renewal fees already due in respect of the earlier application 

up to the date of filing of the divisional application must also be paid on the divisional 

application.  

 
Thus in 2004, the 3rd and 4th renewal fees must be paid. 

 

b) Divisional application filed  
= 29/1/04  

 
 
 
 
 
= due date for 3rd year 

Due date for year four  = 29/2/04  

 
 
 
 
 
→ 1/3/04 R. 85(1) 

 

 
Last day of 4 mo period for paying without an additional fee R. 37(3) for years 3 and 

4 = 29/5/05 

Under R. 37(3) EPC, renewal fees for a divisional application and any falling due 

within a period of 4 months from the filing of the divisional may be paid within the 4 

months without an additional fee. 

 
In this case the 3rd year fee is due on filing and the 4 y fee is due within 4 months 

of filing, therefore both the 3rd and 4th renewal fees can be paid up until 29/5/04 (R. 

37(3)EPC), which is extended to Monday, 31/5/04 under R. 85(1) EPC. 

 


 

 

c)  
Under R. 37(3) EPC) if payment is not made in due time, the renewal fees may 

still be validly paid within 6 months of the due date, provided that the additional fee of 

A 86(2) EPC) is paid within the 6 months as well. 

 
For the 3rd year renewal fee, this 6 months falls due on 29/7/04 (Thursday).  

 
For the 4th year renewal fee, this 6 months falls due on 31/8/04 (Tuesday) (i.e. 6 

months from the end of Feb 2004 applying de ultimo ad ultimo under J 4(91). 

 

2)  
Under A 8 PCT, an international application may contain a declaration, claiming 

the priority of one or more earlier applications filed in for any country party to the 

Paris Convention (PC). 

 
Under A 66 EPC, an EP application which is accorded a date of filing is 

equivalent to a national filing. Thus priority may be claimed from a European 

application. 

 
In the case the requirement that the priority claim be made within 12 months of 

the date of filing of the first application has also been met (A 4C(1) PC). 

 
The problem in this case is the requirement of A 4C(2) PC for the priority claim to 

be based on the first application; that is the application which first describes the 

subject matter. 

 
When EP FIRST was filed, the German utility model was in existence and had 

rights outstanding therein. If it did not have outstanding rights then it would not have 

gone on to publish. Thus the conditions of A 4C(4) PC are not met for basing the 

priority claim on the later application. 

 
In this regard it is important to not that under A 4 A (1) and (2) PC, a priority right 

is established on the basis of a utility model.  

 
This means that the priority claim in the PCT application is invalid; hence the 

effective date for all the subject matter herein is the filing date, i.e. 23/9/03. 

 
This means that the public availability of the German utility model in Dec 2002 will 

be available as full prior art against the PCT application A 33 PCT. 

 

3)  
If only the opponent appealed the decision, then the patent proprietor is only a 

party as of right to the proceedings (A 107 EPC). 

 
In 99/92 it was held that if the opponent is the sole appellant, the patent proprietor 

is restricted during Appeal to defending the patent in the form in which it was 

maintained by the Opposition division. This is “Reformutio in pesus”. Thus generally 

the patent proprietor will not be allowed to reinstate granted claim 1. 


 

 

 
The only way in which the patent proprietor would be allowed to make this 

amendment would be if the patent as maintained in amended form would otherwise 

have to be revoked as a direct consequence of an inadmissable amendment held 

allowable by the opposition division (91/99).  

In this case this seems unlikely since the amendment simply involved combining 

claims; thus it is unlikely that the patent proprietor will be permitted to reinstate claim 

1 as granted. 

 

4)  
For the filing of an international application, the EPO is acting as a receiving office 

under A 151(1) EPC. Under R. 104(1) EPC, however, when the EPO acts as 

receiving office, the international application shall be filed in French, German or 

English. 

 
Under R. 12.1 a) PCT, an international application shall be filed in any language 

which the receiving office accepts for this purpose. This requirement is not met since 

the application is filed in Spanish, and only French, German and English are 

accepted (as stated above). 

 
In this situation, R. 19.4 ii) PCT provides that if the international application is in 

the wrong language, the application shall be considered to have been received by 

that office (i.e. by the EPO) on behalf of the IB as the receiving office. 

 
Under R. 19.4 b) PCT, the EPO will promptly transmit the application to the IB 

and the international application so transmitted will be considered to have been 

received by the IB as receiving office on the date of receipt of the international 

application by the EPO. In this case this means that the filing date of 15/3/04, and 

the priority claim, remains. The EPO may charge a transmittal fee for having done 

this (R. 19.4 b) PCT). 

 
As the application has been transmitted to the IB, the fees will now need to be 

paid directly to it. Under R. 19.4 c) PCT, the deadline by which the fees (transmittal 

fee, R. 14.1 PCT, international fee, R. 15.1 PCT and search fee, R. 16.1 b) PCT) 

must be paid is calculated from the date on which the international application is 

actually received be the IB, rather than the filing date. Thus these will be due 1 

month from the date on which the IB received the application.  

 
Meanwhile, the EPO will refund the fees which were paid to it as these were paid 

without legal basis. The only exception to this is that the EPO is entitled to keep an 

amount equal to the transmittal fee for forwarding the application to the IB (R. 19.4 b) 

PCT).


 

 

 
May also need to consider the issue of representation. Need a representative 

who can act before the Spanish patent office who would be competent RO. 

 

5) 

a)  
Under A 75(1) b) EPC a European application may be filed at the central 

industrial property office of a contracting state. Nat Law Book, table II confirms that 

applications may be filed at INPI and that the application may be filed in any 

language allowed under A 14(1) or (2) EPC. 

 
Under A 14(2) EPC a national of state which has a language other than English, 

French or German may file the European application in an official language of that 

state, even when they are resident abroad. Thus the Greek applicant living in Paris is 

entitled to file the application in Greek, since Greek is the official language of 

Greece.  

 
However, A 14(2) EPC who provides that when an application has been filed in 

such a language, a translation into one of the official languages must be provided. A 

14(1) EPC states that French, English and German are the official languages.  

R. 6(1) EPC provides that the deadline for filing this translation is no later than 13 

months after the date of priority. In this case this is by 13 March 2004, extended to 

15 March 2004 under rule 85(1) EPC. This deadline has passed. Thus the 

application will be deemed withdrawn under A 90(3) EPC. 

 

b) 

(i) The application can be re-filed, although it will not be possible to validly claim priority 

from the earlier application of 13/2/03 as more that 12 months have now passed. 

This will, however, only matter if there has been any relevant art published in the 

intervening time. 

 

(ii) He can use this application to claim priority from in a re-filed application if any new 

subject matter was added in over the original priority application. 

 

(iii) Apply for restitutio (A 122) of the deadline for filing the translation within 2 months of 

removal of the cause for non-compliance (which in this case is likely to be a 

notification under R. 69(1)), by requesting restitutio, paying the fee, filing the 

translation, and setting out why despite all due care the deadline was missed. 


 

 

6)  
EP 1 – As the applicant indicated on F 1001 that he intended to pay the 

designation fees for AT, BE, ES, DE and NL only, the applicant has waived his right 

to a R. 85(a)(1) EPC communication in respect of all other states. 

 
The deadline for paying the designation fees is 6 months from the date on which 

the EPB mentions publication of the search report, i.e. 2/10/03 (A 79(2) EPC). On 

this date the designation fees were timely paid for AT, BE, ES, DE.  

 
For NL, the applicant will receive a communication informing him that he has not 

paid the designation fee (R. 85(a)(1) EPC) and the deadline for paying it with a 

surcharge is 1 month from the date of that notification.  

 
For other states, no such notification will issue (see paragraph 1 above), thus the 

deadline for paying the designation fees, along with a surcharge is set by R. 85(a)(2) 

EPC and is 2 months from the missed deadline, i.e. 2/12/03. 

 
If both apply then any designation fee can be paid, with surcharge, up to the later 

of the two dates (J 5/91). But both of these have passed. Thus in EP 1, only AT, BE, 

ES and DE can be designated. 

 

 
EP 2 was filed prior to the deadline for paying the designation fees on EP 1. Hence 

as F1001 contains a pre-checked box designating all contracting states, any 

contracting state can be designated. G4/98 confirmed that the subsequent non-

payment of designations in the patent does not affect the designations on the already 

filed divisional application. 

 

 
EP 3 -This was filed after the deadline for paying the designation fees on EP 1. 

G4/98 confirmed that when no designation fee is paid by the expiry of the grace 

periods of R. 85a that the designation is deemed withdrawn at the expiry of the 

normal limit of A 79(2) EPC. Thus when EP 3 was filed only the designations of AT, 

BE, ES and DE were pending in EP 1. Hence under A 76(2) EPC only these states 

(AT, BE, ES, DE) can be designated in EP 3. 


 

 

7) C1 24/6/03 

R. 78(2) EPC  
→ 4/7/03 deemed received  

4 months → 4/11/03 

but requested extension under R. 84 on 28/10/03 

2 months  → 4/1/03 

 

C2 dated 8/1/04 informing rejection of extension 

 

C3 dated 22/1/04 R. 69(1) EPC communication 

R. 78(2) EPC  
→ 1/2/04 deemed received 

 

a)  
The application on today’s date (24/3/04) is deemed withdrawn under A 96(3) 

EPC because of the failure to reply to the A 96(2) EPC communication.  

The application can be saved by requesting further processing under A 121 EPC. 

This is done by requesting further processing, paying the further processing fee, and 

filing a response to the outstanding A 96(2) EPC communication. The deadline for 

doing these things is 1/4/04 (Thursday) i.e. 2 months from the date of decision 

communicating that the application is deemed withdrawn (A 121(2) EPC). 

 

b)  
No, an Appeal would not admissable as the communication dated 8/1/04 does not 

terminate proceedings as required by A 106(3) EPC. This was confirmed by J 37/89. 

 

c)  
The finding as to the loss of rights can be appealed providing that the Applicant 

replies to the communication under R. 69(1) EPC dated 22/1/04 within 2-months 

stating that he considers the finding of loss inaccurate and the EPO maintains its 

position that the loss is correct. The deadline for applying for such a decision under 

R. 69(2) EPC is 1/4/04. 

 
An adverse decision which results from this request for a decision will be 

appealable under A 106 since it is taken by an Examining division. 


 

 

8) 

a)  
No, it is only possible to have the finding of the ISA as it the number of inventions 

reviewed if the applicant pays additional search fees. 

 
Under A 17.3 a) PCT, the ISA issues an invite to the Applicant to pay additional 

search fees if it considers that more than one invention is claimed. R. 40 PCT sets 

out the procedure for doing this and includes a protest procedure (R. 40.2 c)- e) 

PCT). This procedure provides for the lack of unity opinion held by the ISA to be 

reviewed by a three membered Board. 

 
However, R. 40.2 c) PCT specifically states that the additional fees may be paid 

under protest. Thus it does not allow for protest in the absence of payment of such 

additional fees. 

 

b)  
Under A 17.3 a) PCT, the non-payment of fees means that the international 

search report will be established on those parts of the application which relate to the 

invention first mentioned in the claims. The other subject-matter will remain 

unsearched.  

 
This means that the international preliminary examination will be restricted to 

those parts of the application which have been searched. The international 

preliminary examination report will state that this is the case (R. 70(0) PCT). 

 
It is important to note, however, that the non-payment of the additional search 

fees does not meant hat the ISA or IPEA (or any of the designated offices) can 

assume that the non-searched subject matter has been abandoned. 

 

9) 

a)  
Under A 33(2) and (3) PCT, an invention claimed is considered novel and 

inventive if it is not anticipated by the prior art as defined by the rules.  

 
Rule 64 PCT defines for the purposes of A 33(2) and (3) PCT, what constitutes 

prior art.  

 
Specifically, R. 64.1 b) PCT provides that where the making available to the 

public occurred by an oral disclosure before the filing date of the application and the 

date of the oral disclosure is indicated on a written document (in this case the 

compendium) on a date later than the filing date, the non-written disclosure shall not 

be considered as part of the state of the art for A 33(2) and (3). This applies in this 

case since the oral disclosure making the claimed invention publically available  


 

 

occurred 1 week before filing, but the compendium in writing was not available until 

after filing. Hence the professor’s oral disclosure does not count as prior art 

according to R. 64.2 PCT. Nevertheless the IPER shall call attention to the lecture. 

 

b)  
Yes, under A 54(2) EPC, it is stated that the state of the art comprises everything 

made available to the public by means of written or oral description before the date 

of filing of the application.  

 
As the date of filing is the international filing date and the public lecture took place 

before this date, it will be prior art for both novelty and inventive step under A 54(2) 

and A 56 EPC. 

 

10)  
No, I would not advise my client to file a Swiss national application and then try to 

claim priority from it in a later EP application. I advise my client to file a European 

application today! 

 
Under A 55(1) EPC, a disclosure of an invention shall not be taken into 

consideration if it occurred no earlier than 6 months preceding the filing of the 

European application if it has been displayed at an officially recognised international 

exhibition. 

 
93/98 confirmed that the calculation of the 6-month period is to the actual date of 

filing of the European application, and the date of priority is not taken into account 

when calculating this period.  

 
Hence as the invention was first disclosed at the exhibition on 24/9/03, the 6 

month deadline for filing the EP is today, 24/3/04! The application can be filed by fax 

if necessary, R. 24 EPC. 

 
In order for the disclosure to be discounted it must be stated at the time of filing 

the application that the invention has been so displayed so this should be done. 

There is no remedy for not filing this statement. 

 
Moreover it will be necessary to file a supporting certificate within 4 months of the 

filing of the application i.e. by 23/7/04 (Friday). This must be the certificate which was 

issued at the exhibition by the authority responsible and state that the invention was 

displayed there. The certificate must also state the opening date of the exhibition, 

and as the opening date did not coincide with the first disclosure, the first date of 

disclosure (i.e. 23/9/03). The certificate should also be accompanied by an 

identification of the invention, duly authenticated. 


 

 

 
N3 – this assumes that the exhibition is one which falls within the terms of the 

convention in international exhibitions as set out in A 55(1) EPC. If not, then the 

exhibition will count as part of the state of the art under A 54(2) EPC. 

 

11)  
The R. 69(1) EPC communication dated 4/9/03 is deemed received on 14/9/03 

(R. 78.2 EPC). Thus the deadline for requesting further processing, paying the fee 

and completing the omitted act is 14/11/03 (A 121(2) EPC).  

 
A121(1) EPC, however, states that the legal consequence of deemed withdrawal 

following failure to reply to a time limit shall not ensure if the applicant requests 

further processing. 

 
According to R. 20(3) EPC, a transfer has effect vis a vis the EPO “only when” the 

request for transfer is filed and a document satisfying the EPO that the transfer has 

taken place have been produced. The wording “only when” in R. 22(3) EPC means 

that the earlier date mentioned in the assignment is irrelevant for the EPO. 

 
Hence on the date on which the request for further processing was filed, as far as 

the EPO is concerned, company A is the applicant, not company B. Hence the 

request of company B for further processing is not valid as they are not the applicant 

as required by A 121(1) EPC.
