Part I: Legal Questions 

 

 

 

QUESTION 1 
(6 POINTS) 

 

On 7 August 2014, applicant A filed PCT-A with the EPO as receiving Office. PCT-A 

does not claim priority of an earlier application and contains two claims, independent 

claim 1 and independent claim 2. In February 2015, the applicant received from the EPO 

as International Searching Authority (ISA) a partial search report for the first invention 

and an invitation to pay an additional search fee for the second invention. The applicant 

did not respond to the invitation. The applicant received an international preliminary 

report on patentability (IPRP) repeating the lack of unity objection and with a positive 

opinion for the first invention. 

 

Today (7 March 2017), the applicant would like to have the second invention searched 

by the EPO. 

 

Consider the following two situations: 

 

a) Advise the applicant on how to have the first invention granted as a European patent 

as soon as possible and to get the second invention searched. 

 

b) The applicant only wants to pursue one European patent application but does not 

know yet for which invention he wishes to obtain protection. Advise the applicant on 

which steps to take to be able to base this decision on a search from the EPO for both 

inventions.

QUESTION 2 
(6 POINTS) 

 

 

Company B filed a notice of opposition against European patent EP-C. Patent proprietor 

is company C with principal place of business in the USA. Company C appointed Ms Y 

as professional representative. Mr X has been appointed as professional representative 

by company B. The EPO summoned both parties to oral proceedings. The final date for 

making written submissions in preparation for the oral proceedings has been fixed to 

today (7 March 2017). 

 

a) In response to the summons, Ms Y communicated to the EPO the termination of her 

authorisation because the patent has been transferred to company D with principal place 

of business in the USA. Ms Y forwarded a copy of the summons to company D. Which 

steps have to be taken for company D to file an amended set of claims by the final date 

fixed in the summons? 

 

b) The business assets of company B in relation to which the opposition had been filed 

have been transferred to company E. Company B contractually agreed the transfer of 

the opposition to company E. Mr X has been appointed as professional representative 

by company E. Which steps have to be taken by Mr X for company E to acquire 

opponent status and appear as opponent at the oral proceedings?

QUESTION 3 
(4 POINTS) 

 

 

Today, 7 March 2017, you receive an e-mail from a patent attorney in Japan. He asks 

you to file a European patent application claiming the priority of Japanese patent 

application JP 12345, containing a description, claims and drawings, filed in Japanese at 

the Japan Patent Office (JPO) on 7 March 2016. The text of the e-mail does not contain 

any details about the applicant but mentions two attachments: one attachment with a 

copy of JP 12345 as filed, and one attachment with the applicant’s name and contact 

details. However, the attachments were corrupted and cannot be opened. 

 

In the e-mail the patent attorney in Japan informed you that he cannot be contacted 

today. However, you were instructed to file the application today. 

 

How will you proceed?

QUESTION 4 
(6 POINTS) 

 

 

In June 2016 the president of company F mentioned during a television interview the 

upcoming launch of their new smart phone. In July 2016, company F filed US provisional 

patent application US-P disclosing smart phone TEL1. As of August 2016, any potential 

buyer could request a password to access technical information describing smart phone 

TEL1 available on the website of F. In autumn 2016 company F found out that the 

antenna ANT1 of smart phone TEL1 did not guarantee indoor reception of telephone 

calls. It is generally known since 2015, that a different antenna, ANT2, provides better 

indoor reception for smart phones. Therefore, company F developed smart phone TEL2 

by replacing in TEL1 antenna ANT1 with antenna ANT2. In December 2016, company F 

filed a European patent application EP-F with a single claim directed to smart phone 

TEL2. EP-F claims priority of US-P. Company F started selling smart phone TEL2 in 

January 2017.   

 

Is TEL2 patentable in view of each of the above disclosures or any combination of these 

disclosures?

QUESTION 5 
(10 POINTS) 

 

 

French applicant G intended to file international application PCT-G claiming priority of 

French patent application FR-NAT1 filed on 16 February 2016 and French patent 

application FR-NAT2 filed on 12 February 2016. Despite all due care taken by the 

applicant, PCT-G was filed on 14 February 2017 with the EPO as receiving Office. PCT-

G did not claim priority of FR-NAT2.  

 

a) How can the priority claim based on FR-NAT2 be added to PCT-G?  

 

b) What is the effect of the addition of the priority claim based on FR-NAT2 on the time 

limit for entry into the European phase? 

  

c) What can the applicant do before the EPO as receiving Office to avoid that the priority 

right of FR-NAT2 claimed for PCT-G is considered invalid in the procedure for the grant 

of a European patent before the EPO as designated Office?

Part II: Legal Questions 

 

 

[001] Today is 7 March 2017. I am the research manager of STEELCO, a manufacturer 

of metal beams in England. Metal beams are formed from metal strips and are used as 

supports in buildings. The length of a metal beam is limited by its strength because 

longer beams are prone to buckle. Beams of greater length are manufactured from 

metal of greater thickness with a correspondingly greater cost. 

 

[002] In 2013 we developed a new process for manufacturing beams having much 

greater strength using thinner metal strips. The process involves passing metal strips 

between two rollers, each roller having teeth formed on its peripheral surface. This 

rolling process forms distinctive projections visible on the metal surface which 

significantly improve strength and allow longer beams with thinner, cheaper metal strips. 

This effect is surprising because it was widely accepted at that time that beams without 

surface imperfections and projections would be stronger. On 23 September 2013 we 

filed a British patent application, ST-GB1, without a claim to priority. ST-GB1 describes 

the rolling process and describes and claims a metal beam having projections formed by 

rolling a metal strip between two rollers having teeth. We allowed ST-GB1, which has 

not been published, to irretrievably lapse. 

 

[003] After some experimenting we found that rollers with teeth of a particular shape, 

SHAPE-A, produced significantly stronger beams. A SHAPE-A tooth creates a visible 

SHAPE-A projection. In November 2013 we attended a trade fair in the United Arab 

Emirates (UAE) at which we demonstrated beams having SHAPE-A projections. We 

also presented test results showing how the beams exhibit very high strength and a 

video showing the rolling process. The trade fair generated considerable interest 

amongst potential new UAE customers.

[004] On 15 September 2014 we filed a European patent application, ST-EP1, claiming 

priority from and including the description and the single claim of ST-GB1. ST-EP1 also 

includes a description of a metal beam having SHAPE-A projections formed by rolling a 

metal strip between a pair of rollers having SHAPE-A teeth and a dependent claim 

directed to such a beam.  

 

[005] The search report for ST-EP1 cites a publication from 1982, OLD1, describing a 

metal stamping process whereby projections are stamped onto a metal strip. I explained 

in a letter to the EPO that stamping metal strips causes stress effects that are visible on 

a metal surface leading to a measurable reduction in strength, and that only a rolling 

process, with or without teeth, can guarantee to avoid these stress effects. I received a 

communication under Rule 71(3) EPC regarding ST-EP1. The communication was 

dated 21 October 2016 and gave a four month period for reply. I have not responded to 

the communication yet but I understand that the EPO will grant a patent for ST-EP1. 

Since October 2016 we have been selling our metal beams with SHAPE-A projections to 

CASITAS S.A., a Spanish construction company operating in Spain. We receive 

considerable revenue from CASITAS. 

 

[006] Last week I received a letter from CASITAS pointing out a Chinese company, 

CHINABEAM, which recently started importing and selling strengthened metal beams in 

Spain. I obtained a sample beam from CHINABEAM and it has the visibly distinctive 

SHAPE-A projections that can only be formed by a rolling process with SHAPE-A teeth. 

The price of CHINABEAM products is 15% lower than the price of our products and 

CASITAS asked me why they should continue to buy our beams if they can import 

identical products at lower cost from China.

[007] At the end of March 2016 we were contacted by an independent consultant from 

Italy, Mr G, who had filed on 11 March 2016 as sole applicant a European patent 

application, ST-EP2, without a claim to priority. ST-EP2 describes and claims a metal 

beam having projections of a different particular shape, SHAPE-B, formed by rolling 

between rollers having SHAPE-B teeth. Mr G demonstrated to us that beams with 

SHAPE-B projections surprisingly exhibit considerably improved strength over beams 

with SHAPE-A projections. After negotiations Mr G transferred ST-EP2 to us in a 

contract dated 4 April 2016 and signed by both Mr G and STEELCO. Mr G informed us 

that he had not paid any fees for the application ST-EP2. The transfer was registered 

with the EPO and includes the transfer of the right to claim priority. Immediately after the 

transfer Mr G left for China and our relationship with him ended. On 11 April 2016 we 

published an article in a trade journal disclosing the contents of ST-EP2. At that time we 

were working on further improvements to the SHAPE-B projections so we paid no fees 

at all to the EPO for ST-EP2. 

 

[008] In February 2017, I received an e-mail from CASITAS in which they forwarded 

details of international application CB-PCT and according to which CB-PCT was 

originally filed on 10 June 2016 in the names of Mr G and CHINABEAM and claims 

priority from ST-EP2. CB-PCT was filed at the EPO with the EPO as International 

Search Authority. CASITAS informed us that Mr G subsequently assigned his share of 

CB-PCT to CHINABEAM. CASITAS also forwarded a document containing the 

description and claims for CB-PCT. CB-PCT includes the description and the claim of 

ST-EP2. CB-PCT further describes rollers with teeth having a shape, SHAPE-B1, that is 

a very particular type of SHAPE-B and which produce beams having SHAPE-B1 

projections. CB-PCT explains that beams with SHAPE-B1 projections have surprisingly 

much greater strength than beams with any other SHAPE-B projections. CB-PCT 

includes independent claim 2 directed to a metal beam having SHAPE-B1 projections 

formed by rolling a metal strip between a pair of rollers having SHAPE-B1 teeth. 

CASITAS indicate that CHINABEAM have offered them beams with SHAPE-B1 

projections at a lower price than the beams they obtain from us.



[009] We also identified the surprisingly good effects of SHAPE-B1 projections 

completely independently of CHINABEAM and we filed our own European patent 

application ST-EP3 on 13 June 2016 claiming priority from ST-EP2. ST-EP3 includes 

the description of ST-EP2 and further describes SHAPE-B1 projections. The sole claim 

of ST-EP3 is directed to a metal beam having projections formed by rolling a metal strip 

between a pair of rollers having SHAPE-B1 teeth. Soon after filing ST-EP3, in July 2016, 

we received a notification of loss of rights for ST-EP2. 

 

[010] I just had a phone call from my contact at CASITAS and he was very upset. He 

told me CHINABEAM have indicated that, if granted, ST-EP1 would be invalid because 

we disclosed our beams at the trade fair in the UAE, and CHINABEAM intend to file an 

opposition at the EPO with evidence obtained from one of our UAE customers. 

CASITAS want to meet urgently to discuss the order they placed with us.  

 

[011] We conducted a worldwide search of CHINABEAM patents and only found a 

European patent CB-EP based on a European patent application filed on 15 October 

2013 without a claim to priority. The mention of the grant of CB-EP was published on 8 

June 2016. CB-EP describes and claims a rolling process for forming metal beams by 

rolling a metal strip between a pair of rollers. There is no mention of rollers having teeth 

or beams having projections in CB-EP. 

 

[012] To make matters worse, I also just heard CHINABEAM have offered low cost 

metal beams with SHAPE-B1 projections to one of our customers in the UAE which we 

are keen to keep. The projections are visibly formed by a rolling process.
