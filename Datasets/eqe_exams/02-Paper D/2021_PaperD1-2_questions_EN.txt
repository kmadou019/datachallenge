Part I: Legal Questions

QUESTION 3 
     (7 MARKS)

Your client C has two pending European patent applications: EP-C1 and EP-C2. The 

search and examination fees for both applications were paid on filing. 

As regards EP-C1, you received last week an invitation pursuant to Rule 58 EPC to file 

one or more claims. 

EP-C2 was filed using EPO Form 1001, with the applicant waiving his right under 

Rule 70(2) EPC. The European search report was transmitted last month. It cited a 

novelty-destroying document. 

Following a strategic reorientation, your client C is no longer interested in the two 

applications. 

He asks you whether the search and/or examination fees can be refunded and at which 

rate. What do you have to do to obtain the refunds?

QUESTION 4 
     (8 MARKS)

On 8 June 2020 applicant D filed European patent application EP-D1 claiming priority 

from US patent application US-D filed on 7 June 2019. EP-D1 describes and claims a 

bolt made of metal. The contents of EP-D1 and US-D are identical. 

The European search report for EP-D1 cites European patent application EP-D0 filed by

applicant D in February 2019 and published in August 2020. EP-D0 relates to the same 

technical field and discloses the same bolt but made of aluminium. EP-D0 does not 

mention any other metal than aluminium.

(a) Is EP-D0 novelty destroying for the subject-matter of the claim of EP-D1?

(b) If yes, can the claim of EP-D1 be amended to make its subject-matter novel?

(c) What would be the answer to (a) and (b) if EP-D0 had been early published in 

April 2020?
