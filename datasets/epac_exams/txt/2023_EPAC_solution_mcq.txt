Question 2: A  
Legal basis  
Representative X is a representative according to article 134.1 EPC and is already registered as representative for the European patent application EP-A, so any registration of change in representation by a new European patent attorney necessitates an authorization for representation signed by the applicant to be validly registered by the EPO.  
According to rule 152(1) EPC, The President of the European Patent Office shall determine the cases in which a signed authorization shall be filed by representatives acting before the European Patent Office.  
In decision of the President of the EPO of 12.07.2007 on the filing of authorizations (Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, L.1), (2) If the European Patent Office is informed of a change of representative involving professional representatives who are not members of the same association, without being notified that the previous representative's authorization has terminated, the new representative must file, together with the notification of his appointment, an individual authorization (original and one copy) or a reference to a general authorization already on file.  
If an authorization for representation is not provided, any acts done by the “new” representative will be deemed to never have occurred by the EPO. R 152(6)  
Representative Y shall file a change in representation with form 5060 to register before the EPO as the new representative, an authorization of representation signed by the applicant for the change in representation to be valid and a response to the written opinion before the EPO before:  
Time limit to respond to the negative search opinion: publication date of the EESR: 12 April 2023 + 6 months (R 70a(1) + R 70(1) EPC) = 12 October 2023 (Tuesday).

Question 10: C (the most correct answer), D (also possible)  
Legal basis  
Art. 121(1) (2), Rule 135(1) and (3) EPC, Art. 2(1), item 12 RFees  
Guidelines for Examination E-VIII, 2 (Further processing) and E-VIII, 3.1.3  
E-IX, 2.3.1 (Representation, address for correspondence).

Comment:  
A good paralegal will perform all acts of C, including the appointment of the representative. However, formally/grammatically D can also be considered as a correct answer to the question, because the appointment of the professional representative can be done later (if the translation is supplied and the fees are paid, but no professional representative has been appointed, the JP applicant may be invited to appoint a professional representative under R 163(5) EPC. The procedural acts of requesting examination and filing the translation could also be considered as unsigned documents, because the JP applicant is not entitled to sign. He might receive an invitation under R 50(3) EPC to supply a missing signature, which can be fulfilled by appointing a professional representative.
