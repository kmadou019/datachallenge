(b) OPT-EP1 is the first valid filing for two ducts (FEED-2) and is novel and inventive. (c) CLEAN is a novel and inventive process, not yet filed. (d) SPRAY is not novel over a 2014 public disclosure. (e) FEED+SPRAY is novel and inventive and only claimed in OPT-PCT.\n\n2. Respond by limiting the claims of OPT-EP1 to two ducts.
