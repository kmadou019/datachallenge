On the other hand, B cannot be reinstated in DIV1, because it is not originally disclosed in DIV1, Art. 123(2) EPC. For DIV2, a valid patent can be obtained. Parent application EP-A was pending when DIV2 was filed, R. 36(1) EPC. As it stands, the claim of DIV2 with feature F extends beyond the content of the parent application, Art. 76(1) EPC, because EP-A does not disclose F in combination with B+D. Hence, feature F needs to be removed from DIV2 to satisfy Art. 76(1) EPC. According to G 1/05, DIV2 can be amended even if EP-A was no longer pending. Feature F is optional.
