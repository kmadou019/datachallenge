The European search report was drawn up for invention X only. A communication pursuant to Article 94(3) EPC setting out a time limit of four months was issued by the EPO on 5 October 2020 and received by applicant A on 8 October 2020.

        "Answer": "(a) Revocation is not pending because debit order by fax is invalid. (b) D should file opposition before 9 March 2023 since (1) revocation is not guaranteed, (2) EP-C may remain in force in Germany if renewal fees are paid, and (3) opposition gives ex tunc revocation unlike mere lapse.",

        "Answer": "1) (a) EP-Z does not validly claim priority and includes an invalid disclaimer. EP-Y becomes full prior art. The claim is invalid due to added matter and lack of inventive step. (b) EP-WA is novel and inventive; renewal fees must be checked. It may proceed to grant. (c) EP-WB is limited to CU-EG and is novel and inventive. Text is approved, grant is expected. (d) EP-WDIV incorrectly claims priority from EP-WA and is invalid. CU-EP is not protected. (e) EP-WC covers CU-Em-transmit and is novel and inventive. Grant is possible. (f) EP-WC describes but does not claim substance X. No protection exists. 2) (a) Yes, Zuma is free as there is no protection on substance X. (b) In Europe, Whiter is not free to sell CU-E(Au)-sound or CU-E(Au)-transmit due to EP-Z claim. Whiter is free to sell CU-EG and CU-EP. In US and China, Whiter is free to sell all products. 3) Refile divisional (EP-WDIV2) from EP-WB to protect CU-EP. File opposition against EP-Z for added matter and inventive step. File PCT for substance X (claiming priority from EP-WC) and another PCT for CU-Em-transmit. Prosecute all in EP, US, and China.",
        "Explanation": "EP-Z's disclaimer violates Art. 123(2) EPC and lacks inventive step. Whiter must secure rights via properly filed divisionals and PCT applications.
