Q1. 
 
 
Dec. 
Received 
R. 140. Dec. 
Rec. 
 
 
        27/12/11 
   29/12/11             24/1/12                       26/1/12 
 
 
 The original decision was in error because a lack of novelty falls under A. 54 
EPC, not A. 56 EPC (which is inventive step). 
 R. 140 allows for decisions to be corrected for obvious mistakes, which is 
clearly the case here.  
 The timetable for filing appeal therefore depends upon which decision is 
appealed: 27/11/11 or 24/1/12. 
 According to T 212/88, correction under R. 140 has retrospective effect, 
meaning that the 27/11/11 decision is “correct”. 
 Hence the time table for appeal is as follows: 
 
 
File Notice of Appeal:  
2m from “decision” (A. 108 EPC) 
 
i.e. 27/12/11 + 10d (notification; R. 126(2) EPC) 
 
 
 
= 6/1/12 
 
 
+ 2m  = 6/3/12 (R. 131(4) EPC) (Tuesday) 
 
 Since today is the final day for filing notice of appeal, I will inform client of this.  
 If client wants to appeal, I can do the following: 
 Time can be saved by filing notice of appeal by fax (R. 2(1); OJ 2007, SE3, 
A.3) 
 Client must at least file notice of appeal to keep options open. 
 Appeal fee also needs to be paid by 6/3/12 (A. 108 EPC). 
 Whilst the appeal fee is expensive, it must be paid. 
 Client then has 4m from decision to file grounds of appeal (A. 108 EPC), thus 
client can make his final decision by: 
 
 
 
 
27/12/11 + 10d (R. 126(2) EPC) = 6/1/12 
 
 
 
 
 
     + 4m (A. 108)  = 6/5/12 (Sunday) 
Extends to Monday 7/5/12 (R. 134(1) EPC) 
Q2. 
 
 
 
EP1 (EN), 1st E.D  = 13/11/07 
 
DIV-1 (EN)   
= 14/12/09 (Munich) 
 
 
 
 
    6/10/11 = S.R. A. 83, no s. fee 
 
DIV-2 (EN) =  
30/09/10 (Berlin!) 
 
 EP1 was filed before 13/12/07, and was therefore filed under EPC 1973. 
 However DIV-1 and DIV-2 were filed after entry into force of EPC 2000, so 
EPC  2000 applies.

a)  
 
DIV-1 
 EP1 must still have been pending when DIV-1 was filed (R. 36(1) EPC). 
 Decision CA/D 2/09 of Admin. Council had not taken effect, so no other time 
limit applied except pendency of the parent EP1. 
 DIV-1 filed in same language as EP1, so the requirement of GL, A-IV-1.3 and 
GL, A-VIII-1.3 was met as required until 1/4/10. 
 Filing at Munich is acceptable (R. 36(2)). 
 
DIV-2 
 Filed after 1/4/10, so Decision CA/9 2/09 takes effect. 
 Although disunity was raised in EESR, this is not a Communication from Exam. 
Div, so R. 36(1)(b) does not take effect (GL, A-IV-1.1.1.2). 
 Thus, DIV-2 is a “voluntary” divisional (R. 36(1)(a) EPC). 
 As such, the 24m time limit runs from the first communication from Exam. 
Division for the original application EP1 (R. 36(1)(a); OJ 2009, 481; GL, A-IV-
1.1.1.2). 
 So, time limit = 13/12/07 + 10d (R. 126(2); GL A-IV-1.1.1.3) = 23/12/07 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
+ 24 m = 23/12/09 (R. 
131(4)) 
 
i.e. DIV-2 filed too late, but … 
 However, Decision CA/D 2/09 provided an amnesty until 1/10/10 where the 
divisional deadline had passed by 1/4/10, so DIV-2 filed in due time. 
 Filing divisional DIV-2 at Berlin is also acceptable (R. 36(2) EPC). 
 
 
 
b)  
 Yes, divisionals cannot be filed from EP1/DIV-2 since they are withdrawn i.e 
not pending (R.36(1) EPC). 
 ‘Mandatory’ divisionals can be filed from DIV-1 provided it is still pending and 
that Exam. Div raises a disunity objection (R. 36(1)(b) EPC). 
 This would trigger a new 24m term (R. 36(1)(b) EPC). 
 If no disunity objection is raised by Exam. Div., then no more divisionals. 
 
 
Q3. 
 
 
 Yes, this can be done by using EPO as SISA (A. 17(1); R. 45bis PCT). 
 Request for SIS must be filed at IB within 19m of filing date along with payment 
of handling fee and supplementary search fee (to IB) (R. 45bis1(a); R. 
45bis2(a); and R. 45bis3(a) PCT). 
 Request must indicate EPO as SISA (R. 45bis1(b)(ii) PCT). 
 Deadline = 5/10/12 + 19m = 5/5/12 (Saturday)

     7/5/12 (Monday) (R.80.5 PCT). 
 
 In request, applicant must indicate that the EPO search is intended to cover the 
second invention (R. 45bis1(d)). 
 EPO as SISA will only search in EN, FR, DE (AG-IP; Annex SISA). 
 However, SPTO as rO only accept Spanish (AG-IP; Annex C) 
 Hence, applicant must submit a translation into EN, FR or DE along with the 
request (OJ 2010, 316). 
 Applicant not required to provide an official representative (A. 49; R.90.1(a) 
PCT). 
 
 
Q4. 
 
 
EP-X (paper)  
 
 
A (A.80 = 20/12/09) 
 
 
 
 
R.45 = 15/2/10 = A1 
PCT1 @ USPTO = EP-X, priority 
 
a) 
 
 Draft paper is the description of EP-X (R.40(1)(c) EPC). 
 PCT1 filed 17/11/10, which is less than 12m after EP-X filing date of 20/12/09 
(A. 8(2)(a) PCT; A. 4C(1)(2) PC). 
 Claim not required for EP filing date (A. 80; R. 40(1) EPC). 
 The description of PCT1 is the same as EP-X (A. 4C(2) PC), so priority is 
probably valid in the international phase. 
 The claim to A1 in PCT1 would have been present at filing (A. 3(2) PCT), so no 
added-matter issue. 
 IPRP probably favourable since the document disclosing A1 was published 
after the priority date. 
 On entry into the EP phase (31m from priority – R. 159(1) EPC: 20/6/12 since 
priority will be assumed valid). 
 EPO will conduct supplementary search (GL, B-11-4.3) which might find the 
document disclosing A1. 
 Otherwise, the ISR will be part of the EP file, so Examiner will see it. 
 Examiner will investigate priority validity since A1 was disclosed between 
priority and filing date (GL, C-V-2.1). 
 Priority will be deemed invalid because A1 is not unambiguously derivable from 
the application as filed (G 2/98; GL C-V-2.2; A. 87(1) EPC). 
 In this regard, the claim to A1 in EP-X is not part of the first application 
because it was not present on the filing date (A. 70(2) EPC). 
 Effective date of PCT-1 claim to A1 is therefore 17/11/10 (A. 89 EPC). 
 Claim will lack novelty over the disclosure of A1 in March 2010 (A. 54(2) EPC). 


 
- 4 -

b) 
 
 Draft paper includes unambiguous disclosure of A1, so priority claim is valid in 
EP (A. 87(1) EPC; G 2/98). 
 Effective date of claim to A1 in PCT-1 is 20/12/09 (A. 89 EPC) 
 Hence, A1 is not state of the art and the claim to A1 will be novel (A. 54(2) 
EPC) and likely inventive (A. 56 EPC). 
 There should be no double patenting objection to identical claims of A1 in EP-X 
and PCT-1 because Applicant has ‘legitimate’ interest in obtaining prolonged 
protection from PCT-1 (T 1423/07). 
 For completeness, the claim to A1 in EP-X was filed in due time (GL, A-III-15; 
R. 57(c) EPC). 
 
Q5. 
PCT – CN @ SIPO  
 
 
ISR 
 
 
 
?/9/10 
?/9/11 
 
a) 
 
 Chinese is a language of publication, so the specification will be published in 
Chinese (R. 48.3(a) PCT) 
 The abstract will be additionally published in English (R. 48.3(c) PCT) 
 The title, declaration according to A. 17(2)(a) PCT, International Search 
Report, and text pertaining to figure(s) in abstract will also be published in 
English (R. 48.3(c) PCT). 
 The A. 19 PCT amendments will be published (R. 48.2(f) PCT) in Chinese. 
 
b) 
 
 Yes, WIPO makes abstract available in all languages of publication (R. 48.3(a) 
PCT), including French. 
 
Q6. 
 
 
IT1 – INV1   
 
IT2 – INV2 
= 28/10/10 
 
 EP1 filed in due time to claim priority from IT1 and IT is a PC state, so priority 
is valid (A. 87(1) EPC). 
 Effective date for Inv1 is EP1 is 28/10/10 (A. 89), so D is not state of the art (A. 
54(2)) and Inv1 is novel. 
 At present, Inv2 has an effective date of 28/10/11 (A. 89) and lacks novelty 
over D (A. 54(2)). 
 Applicant should claim priority from IT2 to make effective date of Inv2 also 
28/10/10 (A. 89 EPC). 
 Multiple priorities are allowable (A. 88(2) EPC; G 2/98). 


 
- 5 -

 Priority claim can be added up to 16m from the earliest priority date (i.e. 
28/10/10) (R. 52(2) EPC). 
 So, deadline is 28/10/10 + 16m = 28/02/2012 (R. 131(4)). 
 Hence, the deadline has been missed (R 52(2)). 
 FP is not available (A. 121; R. 135(2) EPC). 
 Applicant can apply for re-establishment (A. 122) if he can prove missed 
deadline was despite ‘all due care’. 
 Without successful RE, applicant can use EP1 to get prosecution for whole of 
EP for Inv1 with EP1 and Inv2 in IT with IT2. 
 
Q7. 
 
 Methods of Diagnosis are not patentable according to A. 53(a) EPC 
 However, not all methods of diagnosis are excluded (GL, C-IV-4.8.1), only 
those methods including: 
1. Examination phase 
2. Comparison with known values 
3. Finding deviation 
4. Decision phase  (G 1/04; GL, C-IV-4.8.1). 
 
 If all these phases are present, then it is prohibited. 
 However, if it not clear whether ‘on the basis of the tissue sample in the 
analysing liquid’ constitutes steps 2 + 3 above, this requires further 
investigation. 
 Moreover, even the implicit presence of steps 1 to 4 results in prohibition under 
A. 53(c) (G 1/09) 
 So, method is probably not patentable. 
 Although step a) represents surgery which is prohibited, (A. 53(c)), this is not 
essential so does not bar patentability. 
 Instead, applicant should claim materials used in method. 
 E.g.  
chemical components per se. 
chemicals for us in any method (A. 54(4) EPC) 
chemicals for use in this method (A. 54(5) EPC; G 2/08) 
 
 
All of which are not excluded by A. 53 EPC

EP1 
 The publication of EP1 on 10/3/10 becomes part of the sate of the art (A. 54(2) 
EPC). 
 After publication, the file of EP1 is open to public inspection (A. 128(4)). 
 The matter filed in June 2011 is ‘new’ and ‘inventive’ over the application as 
filed (A. 70(2) EPC). 
 In view of the unitary concept of disclosure in the EPC (G 2/98; G 2/04; G 
2/10), matter which is new and inventive cannot be unambiguously derivable 
therefrom. 
 Accordingly, the new matter will not be granted via EP1 because it adds 
subject-matter (A. 123(2) EPC), so no protection via EP1. 
 
EP2 
 As explained above, the file of EP1 is open to public inspection as from 
publication (A. 128(4)). 
 Hence, applicant’s reply in June 11 will also be publicly available (A. 54(2) 
EPC). 
 There may be a delay before the Applicant’s reply is published, but it will be 
available before 9/12/11 (i.e. effective date of EP2 – A. 89 EPC). 
 Thus, applicant’s reply will anticipate EP2 (A. 54(2) EPC). 
 For completeness, it is noted that since the new matter is sufficient (A. 83), 
then it must also be enabling (GL, C-IV-6.3). 
 Hence, EP2 is anticipated by Applicant’s reply to Exam. Division in EP1 (A. 
54(2) EPC). 
 So, neither EP1 nor EP2 will provide protection for the improved matter.
