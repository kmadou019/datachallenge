Part I: Legal Questions 
 

 

QUESTION 1 
(10 POINTS) 

On 20 February 2018, the last day of the priority period, applicant A filed international 

application PCT-A with the EPO as receiving Office. The request was filed using form 

PCT/RO/101. PCT-A was filed in French and duly claims priority of FR-A filed by 

applicant A in French. FR-A contains a description, drawings and one claim, the claim 

spanning two pages. PCT-A was intended to be identical to FR-A. 

Today, 27 February 2018, the applicant noticed that the second page of the 

claim of PCT-A is missing from the documents submitted to the EPO. 

The applicant would like to obtain provisional protection in the EPC Contracting States 

for the subject-matter claimed in FR-A as soon as possible. 

Advise the applicant.

QUESTION 2 
(8 POINTS) 

On 14 December 2016, the mention of the grant of European patent EP-B was 

published in the European Patent Bulletin. EP-B was granted to company B with 

independent claims 1 and 2, and claim 3 dependent on claim 2. On 12 September 2017, 

an opposition was validly filed against EP-B by company C. The notice of opposition 

only mentions the ground of Article 100(c) EPC against claims 1 to 3. In response to an 

invitation under Rule 79(1) EPC, the proprietor requested on 6 February 2018 

maintenance of the patent in amended form based on granted claim 1 and amended 

claim 2 combining granted claims 2 and 3. In addition, the proprietor indicated the basis 

in the application as filed for the subject-matter of claim 1 as granted. Together, the 

amendment and the indicated basis overcome the objections raised under  

Article 100(c) EPC.  

On 22 February 2018, company B instituted proceedings against company D at a 

Swedish court for infringement of EP-B. Today, 27 February 2018, the opposition 

proceedings are pending. 

Company D, who wants to be a party to the proceedings before the EPO, provided you 

with document D1, which is prior art pursuant to Article 54(3) EPC for EP-B and 

discloses the subject-matter of claim 1 of EP-B. Company D is of the opinion that claim 3 

as granted does not meet the requirements of Article 84 EPC. Advise company D what 

steps can be taken in the proceedings before the EPO against: 

a) claim 1 of EP-B; and 

b) amended claim 2 of EP-B.

QUESTION 3 
(8 POINTS) 

On 2 November 2017, applicant E, an inventor having his residence in Argentina, filed 

application EP-E online in Spanish at the EPO using Form 1001. EP-E does not claim 

priority of a previous application. Applicant E filed only claims and drawings.  

On 15 November 2017, applicant E filed the missing description in Spanish at the EPO. 

On 27 November 2017, applicant E filed at the EPO a translation of the description, 

claims and drawings of EP-E into English with an accompanying letter and paid the filing 

and search fees. 

Applicant E received from the EPO an invitation dated 5 February 2018 to appoint a 

representative. 

Yesterday, 26 February 2018, you were asked by applicant E to represent him in 

proceedings before the EPO.  

a) 
Which date of filing will be accorded? 

b) 
Which actions do you need to take as representative for the search of the 

application to be started?

QUESTION 4 
(6 POINTS) 

During oral proceedings on 1 September 2017 the opposition division announced, in 

accordance with Article 101(3)(a) EPC, that taking into consideration the amendments 

made by the proprietor patent, EP-F and the invention to which it relates meet the 

requirements of the EPC. The interlocutory decision dated 15 September 2017 was 

notified by registered letter with advice of delivery. 

Both the opponent and the patent proprietor are adversely affected by this decision. You 

are the representative for one of the parties who immediately after the oral proceedings 

instructed you to file an appeal against this decision. 

Today, 27 February 2018, you received from the EPO a communication under 

Rule 82(2) EPC. From said communication you realise that no appeal has been filed.  

Through online file inspection you notice that your assistant has returned to the EPO the 

acknowledgement of receipt of the notification of the interlocutory decision on 

20 September 2017.  

Due to an isolated mistake within a normally satisfactory system for monitoring time 

limits, your file records do not contain any information about the decision, nor have any 

corresponding time limits been recorded.  

How can you improve your client’s position before the EPO, if 

a) you are the representative for the patent proprietor? 

b) you are the representative for the opponent?

QUESTION 5 
(8 POINTS) 

The EPO issued a communication under Rule 71(3) EPC, in which the Examining 

Division informed applicant G that it intends to grant a patent based on European patent 

application EP-G containing independent claim 1 and dependent claim 2. Yesterday, 26 

February 2018, was the last day of the period for responding to said communication. 

Applicant G duly filed the required translations and paid the fee for grant and publishing. 

Today, applicant G became aware of European patent application EP-H which is state of 

the art pursuant to Article 54(3) EPC. The subject-matter of claim 1 lacks novelty with 

respect to EP-H. The subject-matter of claim 2 is new with respect to EP-H. 

G now wants to restrict the subject-matter for which protection is sought in EP-G to the 

subject-matter of claim 2 of EP-G. 

a) Discuss how G can restrict without paying any further fees to the EPO. 

b) Discuss how G can restrict without having to explain why.

Part II: Legal Opinion 
 

 

[001] Today is 27 February 2018. 

We, Bollebozen B.V. (BB) are active in the food industry, both in the manufacture 

and design of processes and processing equipment and in the large-scale production 

of processed food. One of our products is a Dutch speciality, called “Oliebollen”  

(in English: “oil balls”), which are consumed at the turn of the year. They consist of a 

ball of dough mixed with dried fruit, which is fried. One concern with all fried products 

is that they have high levels of acrylamide, a substance some studies have indicated 

is carcinogenic in high doses.  

 

[002] We have a European patent, EP-BB1, which validly claims priority from an 

earlier application filed in October 2013. An opposition has been filed against  

EP-BB1. Granted claim 1 is directed to a method of preparing a fried food 

product (FFP) with an acrylamide level below 225 ppb, by frying a ball of dough 

containing at least 5 % by weight of dried fruit, wherein the fruit comprises fruit A. 

Claim 2 of the granted patent is dependent on claim 1 and requires the fruit further to 

comprise fruit B. Claim 3 is dependent on claim 1 or 2 and requires the fruit further to 

comprise fruit C.  

 

[003] The opponent attacked the patent under Article 100(b) EPC, demonstrating 

that a fried ball of dough prepared according to claim 1 using fruit A and no other 

dried fruit had a higher level of acrylamide than claimed.

2018/D/EN/7 





 

[004] The patent was maintained in amended form on the basis of granted claim 2. 

The written decision, dated 2 October 2017 was received by us on 16 October 2017. 

The opponent and we each filed a notice of appeal on time and paid the appeal fee. 

We included a main request to reject the opposition. The opponent filed grounds of 

appeal in January 2018, including the results of tests in which a method according to 

the patent using only fruits A and B as dried fruit did not result in a product having the 

claimed acrylamide level.  

 

[005] Due to time pressure, we filed on 15 February 2018 grounds of appeal in the 

form of a letter that merely refers the Board of Appeal to our submissions made at 

first instance. We have since reflected and come to the conclusion that a possible 

fallback position that would cover our product is a combination of claims 1 and 3.  

 

[006] Tests had revealed to us that the acrylamide level remains lower than 225 ppb 

regardless of the fruit content and type if the frying temperature is kept at 220°C or 

lower. If fruit C is present, any frying temperature within the usual range may be 

chosen. 

 

[007] We know all this because we investigated the temperature-dependency after 

the opposition had been filed. These investigations led us to further patent 

applications.

[008] We filed EP-BB2 on 3 February 2017. EP-BB2 describes and claims a method 

of preparing a fried food product (FFP) by frying a ball of dough at a temperature in 

the range of 150-220°C. The description states that the preferred range is between 

175°C and 200°C. EP-BB2 also discloses an apparatus we had designed previously. 

It includes a dough mixer and a nozzle mounted thereon for forming the balls of 

dough. This nozzle is shown and described as having the shape of a trumpet. 

Nozzles with such a shape had been used in totally different fields of technology 

before EP-BB2 was filed. From the end of the 20th century onwards, conically shaped 

nozzles have been used in combination with dough mixers and screw conveyors to 

force the dough through the nozzles. No fees were paid for EP-BB2 and we received 

a notice of loss of rights in June 2017. Instead of continuing with EP-BB2 we filed an 

international application, PCT-BB2, on 4 December 2017. We paid the filing fee, 

search fee and transmittal fee on filing. PCT-BB2 has the same claim as EP-BB2 and 

claims priority from it.  

 

[009] We had realised that the trumpet-shaped nozzle presented the advantage, that 

the liquid content of the dough could be higher than with the conical shape, further 

lowering acrylamide levels. Consequently, we left out the description of the shape of 

the nozzle in PCT-BB2 in order to file a separate patent application directed to this 

invention. We added to the description that it is crucial that the nozzle is combined 

with a screw conveyor to expel the dough from the mixer. The description of the 

apparatus and method in PCT-BB2 is otherwise identical to that of EP-BB2.

[010] We filed EP-BB3 on 26 January 2018. EP-BB3 describes and claims the 

apparatus, including both the dough mixer and the trumpet-shaped nozzle. The 

screw conveyor is not mentioned because it is not required for this type of nozzle. 

We have not paid the fees for this application and intend to file an international 

application claiming priority from EP-BB3 in due course and to enter the regional 

phase before the EPO.  

 

[011] Today, we realised we accidentally included in PCT-BB2 the drawing showing 

the trumpet-shaped nozzle we had also used for EP-BB2 and EP-BB3.  

 

[012] We have been approached by a research institute, the 

Forschungsgemeinschaft des Konditorgewerbes (FK), with an offer for sale of a 

European patent application EURO-PCT-FK1 based on an international application, 

PCT-FK1. This application has a filing date of 31 March 2015. No priority is claimed. 

PCT-FK1 was filed with two independent claims. The first independent claim is 

directed to an apparatus comprising a dough mixer having a nozzle arranged to 

deposit balls of dough into a bath of frying oil. The only disclosed embodiment 

includes a nozzle with a conical shape and a screw conveyor. Due to the nozzle, 

large quantities of foodstuffs can be prepared efficiently. The second independent 

claim is directed to a method of preparing a fried food product (FFP) containing 

fruit D by frying dough at between 155°C and 250°C. The chosen fruit and the 

temperature range in combination make the products crispy on the outside and fluffy 

on the inside for longer. The international search report drawn up by the European 

Patent Office covers both claims. PCT-FK1 entered the regional phase before the 

EPO on time.  

 

[013] FK has told us that they would offer the patent application to one of our 

European competitors if we don’t accept their offer.

[014] In December 2017, our latest variety of “Oliebollen” won a competition 

organised by a Dutch newspaper. We explained in an interview published in the 

newspaper that we think this variety tastes so good because we use fruits A, C and D 

in the mix of dried fruit and that any temperature between 160°C and 210°C leads to 

these tasty products.
