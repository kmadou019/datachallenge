Candidates' answer 

 

Dear Mr. Good, 

 

Thank you for your letters of X March 2006.  I have considered the matters 

you have discussed and can advise you with respect to your specific 

questions as follows. 

 

 

Claims 1 to 5 of Euro-PCT1 

 

Claim 1 

 

Claim 1 is directed to solar panels having undulating walls.  This subject 

matter was first disclosed in your FI patent application (filed on 01.10.2003), 

from which PCT1 validly claims priority (EPCa.87(1), G2/98).  The effective 

filing date of this subject matter in PCT1 is therefore 01.10.2003 (EPCa.89).  

The only disclosure of solar panels with undulating walls before this dare is 

apparently the Tokyo Symposium held in 2002.  Prior use of this nature is part 

of the state of the art under EPCa.54(2). 

 

In order for alleged prior use to be novelty-destroying, it must be clear when, 

what and under which conditions the disclosure took place (D-V, 3.1.2).  As 

the publication of the Symposium of May 2004, although not itself prior art, 

what appear to substantiate these facts, the disclosure of the use of 

undulating walls in 2002 would appear to destroy novelty of claim 1.  Indeed, if 

the prior use was in fact an oral disclosure, the post published written version 

is assumed to be a true account of the disclosure (D-IV, 5.1, last sentence), 

and there does not appear to be any reason to dispute this.

Thus, claim 1 would appear to lack novelty.  However, on the basis of the 

published article, the only disclosure in 2002 was of the use of undulating 

walls to mechanically strengthen the panels.  It may therefore be possible to 

reformulate claim 1 as a ‘use’ claim (C-III, 4.9), directed towards the use of 

undulating walls to increase the thermal efficiency of the panel.  As this use 

was not disclosed in 2002, and as you are aware of no other disclosure, such 

an amendment should render claim 1 patentable, as there was no suggestion 

that this technical would be achieved (EPCa.54 & EPCa.56). 

 

Claim 2 

 

Claim 2 is directed towards solar panels having undulating walls with 5-16 

undulations per metre.  This subject matter was first disclosed in the utility 

model application D1 (filed on 15.03.2004), from which PCT1 validly claims 

priority (EPCa.87(1)) (utility models explicitly mentioned), G2/98).  The 

effective filing date of this subject matter is therefore 15.03.2004 (EPCa.89).  

Again, the Tokyo disclosure of 2002 is comprised in the states of the art under 

EPCa.54(2).  However, as there is no disclosure of panels having undulations 

of 5-16 per metre (the only example has 20 undulations per metre), this claim 

is novel (EPCa.54).  There are no other possible disclosures before the 

15.03.2004 date. 

 

Despite this, I am not confident that claim 2 would be considered inventive 

(EPCa.56).  This is because the technical effect achieved by having 5-16 

undulation per metre is dependent on the size of the panel.  Your Italian 

laboratory says that the panel must be less than 3 metres long for the “better 

results” to be seen.  As claim 2 is not limited to panels of this size, the 

advantage is not present across the entire scope of the claim, and it is 

therefore objectionable for lack of inventive step (EPCa.56) in light of the 

Tokyo 2002 disclosure (T 939/92 “Agrevo”).  I therefore think that claim 2 is 

invalid.   


 
- 3 - 

 

 

The only possible amendment to overcome this would be to incorporate the 

limitation that the panel must be less than 3m.  However, as this would arrive 

at claim 3 anyway, there is no need to do this.  Perhaps restrict to the 

exemplified (1m) panels in this range, if there is basis (EPCa.123(2)). 

 

Claim 3 

 

Claim 3 is directed to solar panels having undulating walls with 5-16 

undulations per metre (U/m) and being less than 3 metres in length).  This 

subject matter was first disclosed in the Italian patent application IT1 (filed 

22.09.2004), from which PCT1 validly claims priority (EPCa.87(1), G 2/98).  

The effective filing date of this subject matter is therefore 22.09.2004. 

 

In this regard, I am not concerned that D1 would be regarded as the “first 

application” for this subject matter (which would invalidate the priority claim to 

IT1 (EPCa.87(1) + EPCa.87(4)) merely because of the Example in that 

document falling within the scope of claim 3, because the test for priority 

entitlement is not the same as the test for novelty in this situation (G 2/98). 

 

The disclosures that pre-date the effective filing date of claim 3 (22.09.2004) 

are the Tokyo Symposium Disclosure of 2002 and the corresponding 

publication of May 2004 (EPCa.54(2)).  However, these would not be novelty-

destroying as the 5-16 U/m feature is not disclosed (the example has 20 U/m).  

D1 was also made available to the public before 22.09.2004 (on 15.09.2004) 

and is therefore also comprised in the state of the art under EPCa.54(2).  

Unfortunately, D1 discloses embodiments wherein the panel of 1m having 

undulating walls with the 5-16 U/m range.  This falls within the scope of claim 

3, such that it lacks novelty (EPCa.54(2)).  This claim is therefore invalid. 

 

EPB will be comprised in the state if the art for claim 3 under EPCa.54(3) and 

(4) for all designated states for which fees are paid (EPCr.23d).   


 
- 4 - 

 

 

As EPB discloses an example solar panel of 2 metres with undulations of 10 

U/m, this will also be novelty destroying for claim 3, provided the designation 

fees are paid. 

 

There does not appear to be much scope for amending claim 3 to render it 

allowable.  We are not told what basis there may be in the application as filed 

(EPCa.123(2)) to get around the publication of D1.  Given that D1 is directed 

towards the same technical effect, and discloses a panel size in the less than 

3m range, it is hard to see how any amendment to sub-ranges of panel size 

would be inventive anyway (EPCa.56).  Claim 3 therefore appears invalid, and 

should be deleted. 

 

CLAIM 4 

 

Claim 4 is directed to solar panels having undulating walls with 15-30 

undulations per metre (U/m) and being more than 3m in length.  This subject 

matter was first disclosed in the Italian patent application IT1 (filed 

22.09.2004), from which PCT1 validly claims priority (EPCa.87(1), G 2/98).  

The effective filing dare of this subject matter is therefore 22.09.2004. 

 

Once again, the two Tokyo disclosures of 2002 and 2004 are part of the state 

of the art under EPCa.54(2).  However, as they do not disclose a solar panel 

of greater than 3m in length (the example is 1m), they will not be novelty 

destroying.  Moreover, the subject matter of claim 4 would be inventive over 

these disclosures (EPCa.56), because they relate to mechanical strength, and 

are nothing to do with improved thermal efficiency. 

 


 
- 5 - 

 

 

The disclosure of D1 on 15.09.2004 is also comprised in the state of the art 

under EPCa.54(2), but as this does not disclose panels greater than 1m in 

length (the example), the feature >3m in length should establish novelty (even 

if this was regarded as a “sub-range” of the unspecified size limits of D1, I 

believe the invention would be regarded as a selection invention under 

T279/89 and C-IV, 7.7(ii) because the sub-range is narrow vis-à-vis the 

undefined range in D1, it is far removed from the example in D1 (1m) and 

there is a technical effect – improved thermal efficiency – associated with the 

new range). 

 

However, EPB would be comprised within the state of the art under 

EPCa.54(3) and (4) for all states in common, because it was filed earlier than 

the effective filing dated of claim 4 (April 2004 vs. 22.09.2004) and publish 

under EPCa.93 after (publication would have been around October 2005).  

The specific example of a solar panel of 4m and 20 undulations/metre would 

destroy the novelty of claim 4. 

 

If this happens (i.e. if the designation fees are paid such that there is a 

problem), then claim 4 could be easily amended to establish novelty.  As EPB 

is a 54(3) document, the specific example could be disclaimed (G1/03 and 

G2/03).  Alternatively, as EPB does not attach any explanation (i.e. purpose or 

effect) to the undulations, claim 4 could be converted into a “use” claim as 

discussed above.  However, this should not be necessary. 

 

Claim 5 

 

Claim 5 is directed towards the extrusion process, as disclosed in F1, filed on 

01.10.2003.  PCT1  validly claims priority from this application (EPCa.87(1)), 

so the effective filing date of this subject matter is 01.10.2003 (EPCa.89).  The 

only earlier disclosure that we know about is the Symposium of 2002, as 

evidenced in the publication of 2004.   


 
- 6 - 

 

 

However, this does not appear to mention any methods for making the 

undulating panels, so claim 5 is certainly novel (EPCa.54).  There is no 

suggestion that the process is obvious (EPCa.56(1)), but I would confirm this 

with client. 

 

N.B.  Forgot to say that a translation of IT1 into French, German or English 

(EPCa.14(1)) will need to be filed before the end of the period set for 

responding to any EPCa.51(4) communication received on Euro-PCT1 to 

maintain the priority date (EPCr.38(5)).  However, as there are no intervening 

disclosures between 22.09.2004 and 01.10.2004 (filing dates of IT1 and PCT1 

respectively), this is not so relevant). 

 

In summary therefore, you should be able to obtain the following claims from 

Euro-PCT1: 

 

(i) 
Use of undulating walls in solar panels to increase thermal 

efficiency. 

(ii) 
Solar panels with undulating walls with 15-30 undulations/metre 

and 
>3m 
in 
length 
(possibly 
with 
4 
metre 
and 
20 

undulations/metre disclaimed); and 

(iii) 
Extrusion process. 

 

May also yet get claim to panels with undulations in 5-16 u/m range, 1m 

length depending on basis. 

 

Extension of Euro-PCT1 

 

Euro-PCT1 was entered into the European regional phase early in November 

2005.  The due date for paying designation fees under EPCa.79(2) is 6 

months from mention of the publication of the search report, which is the date 

of publication of the international search report under EPCa.157(1).   


 
- 7 - 

 

 

PCT1 was due to publish 18 months from the earliest priority date o 

01.10.2003 (PCTa.21(2)(a)) => around 01.04.2005.  The ISR would have 

been published around this time so the 6 month period will have expired 

around October 2005.  Designation fees for Euro-PCT1 are therefore due by 

the later time of 31 months from the earliest priority date (EPCr.107(1)(d) will 

apply, meaning that designation fees can be paid up to 31 months from the 

filing date of F1 (01.10.2003), i.e. 01.05.2006. (Extended to Tuesday 

02.5.2006 on account of EPCr.85(1)). 

 

There is therefore still time to pay the designation fees without surcharge.  

You should pay the fees for the UK and Belgium before the above-noted date 

if you wish to obtain protection there.  As this means you would be paying 5 

designation fees, it seems reasonable to pay 2 more, and thereby have all 

applicable states designated (Rfees 2(3)).  The difference is only €150 (2 

fees), and you say that that you expect good sales “throughout Europe”, so it 

would certainly make sense to pay these additional fees.  It would also mean 

that the application extends to your ‘home’ state (NL) and the ‘various others’ 

where you are active. 

 

If you want to pay these fees late (with surcharges) there is a 2 month grace 

period as from the 02.09.2006 due date (EPCa.108(4), even though you have 

not designated other states on entry; (OJ 2005, 11&126). 

 

National phase entry of PCT1 outside Europe 

 

National phase entry of PCT1 outside Europe could be postponed by 

withdrawing the earliest priority claim in PCT1 under PCTr.90bis.3(b).  To do 

this, a request must be filed at the receiving office or International Bureau 

(PCTr.90bis3(c)) before the expiry of 30 months from the (current) earliest 

priority date, i.e. 30 months from 01.10.2003 = 01.04.2006 (Extended to 

Monday 03.04.2006 on account of PCT r80.5) (PCTr.90bis3(a)). 


 
- 8 - 

 

 

This withdrawal has the effect that any time limit not already expired (which in 

this case includes the 30 month period for entry into the national phase under 

PCTa.22(1), which is Monday 3rd April 2006, as explained above) is re-

calculated as the basis of the next earliest priority date (PCTr.90bis3(d)). 

 

This would mean that the new due date for national phase entry under 

PCTa.22(1) would be 30 months from the filing date of D1 (15.03.2004), 

therefore Friday 15th September 2006.  This is well after the time you expect 

to have decisions from the inventors (June). 

 

For the avoidance of any doubt, withdrawing the first priority claim in this way 

could not effect the priority claim in the Euro-PCT1, because this has already 

been entered into the European regional phase (PCTr.90bis.6). 

 

By developing national phase entry in this way, no surcharges would be due 

for late entry outside Europe.  However, as the effective filing date the subject 

matter in F1 would become the actual filing date of PCT1 (01.10.2004), you 

should bear in mind that it would face the publication of D1 as full prior art, 

rendering the proposed use claim (see above) lacking in novelty.  The 

proposed process claim should not be effected. 

 

Can you stop Mr Bad? 

 

Mr Bad is selling panels with undulating walls (one with 10 undulations per 

metre, the other with 20 undulations per metre) in the UK and Belgium.  He 

also offered to sell various panels in Spain in October 2005. 

 

PCT1 was published around 01.04.2005 (18 months from earliest priority date 

of 01.10.2003 PCTa.21(1)).   


 
- 9 - 

 

 

This publication takes the place of publication of Euro-PCT1 (EPCa.158(1)), 

from which time provisional protection under EPCa.67(1) will have started for 

those states where the language of PCT1 is an official language 

(EPCa.167(3) and Nat. Law Table IIIA). 

 

By selling panels with undulating walls, Mr Bad is infringing claim 1 as filed 

and published.  Moreover, by selling panels with walls with 10 U/m and 20 

U/m he will be infringing claim 2 as published and possibly claim 3 as 

published (if the 10 U/m one is <3m) & claim 4 as published (if the 20 U/m one 

is longer than 3m).  This provisional protection is limited to scope of the 

eventually granted claims (EPCa.69(2)), to his infringement of claims 2 and 3 

(which I do not think will be granted) will be irrelevant.  However, he would still 

be infringing claim 1 in its proposed “use” format (although some states may 

require him to be advertising the “purpose” of the undulations) and claim 4 

(unless he falls within the scope of any disclaimers). 

 

On this basis, Mr Bad will be infringing your patent as published and granted, 

so you will be able to stop him.  However, this protection will be limited to the 

states that are designated in PCT-EP1 and where the eventual patent is 

validated (EPCa.64(1) and EPCa.65).  In those states, you should file 

translations of the claims as published, if needed, to secure provisional 

protection (EPCr.67(3)). 

 

As most states will not allow you to take action until Euro-PCT1 is granted 

(see Nat Law Table IIIA, column 2), you should request accelerated 

prosecution of Euro-PCT1 (C-VI, 1.12; OJ 2001, 459) and accelerated grant 

(EPCa.97(6)) to ensure quick grant. 

 

In the meantime, you should provide Mr Bad with a copy of the claims to 

ensure that he cannot rely on any ‘innocent infringer’ defences. 

 


 
- 10 - 

 

 

In this way, it should be possible to stop Mr Bad marketing his panel in those 

states where Euro-PCT1 is designated and subsequently validated, including 

back-damages for his infringement of the claims as published in PCT1. 

 

Can Mr Bad stop you from marketing the panels? 

 

The only rights that Mr Bad can obtain to stop you are those he can obtain 

from EPB, as you say there are no equivalents elsewhere. 

 

You say the claim in EPB is to a ‘new structure for the superimposed parallel 

sheets’.  Unless you are using this structure in your panels, then you will not 

be infringing EPB and Mr Bad will not be able to stop you on the basis of this 

claim. 

 

There is the possibility of Mr Bad adding claims to EPB based on the 

examples showing panels with undulating walls.  It is unlikely that Mr Bad 

would be able to generalise these examples to brad claims covering the 

undulating wall invention per se.  This is because the examples are limited to 

panels with undulations of 10 U/m and 20 U/m, 2m and 4m respectively.  It is 

not generally possible to base claims on isolated features (T 938/95, 

T1110/97 & T1067/97) (EPCa.123(2)). 

 

Therefore, at best, Mr Bad may be able to obtain claims to the specific panels 

disclosed in EPB. 

 

Whether these claims would be inventive in light of the disclosure of panels of 

1 m with 20 U/m undulations in the Tokyo 2002 disclosure (which would be 

prior art in the same way as it is for PCT1) is debatavle, particularly as EPB 

gives no explanation of the undulations (EPCa.56). 

 

 


 
- 11 - 

 

 

I do not therefore think that Mr Bad will be able to stop you marketing your 

panels.  At best, he may get narrow claims to the specific disclosed panels, 

but you would presumably be able to avoid these claims. 

 

What is more of a problem for you is the prior art effect of the two 

embodiments in EPB, which I noted above were relevant to claims 3 and 4 of 

PCT1 as filed.  Mr Bad has offered to “withdraw the conflicting embodiments 

for the three countries (DE, FR, IT)”.  However, this does not make sense, as 

there is no basis for doing this under the EPC.  Perhaps he means not pursue 

EPC at all in these states, by not paying the designation fees (which should 

be due this month, March, i.e. 6 months from an estimates publication date 

(with search report for direct–EP with no priority claim) of October 2005 

(EPCa.79(2) & EPCa.93(1)).  Given that these are such important states, I 

doubt Mr Bad will want to do this.  Moreover, as you are now intending to 

pursue Euro-PCT1 in other designated states, he would have to not pay 

designation fees for all these states to remove the prior art effect of EPB 

under EPCa.54(3) and (4) & EPCr.23(d). 

 

If he is happy to do this, then good.  However, a better approach would be to 

establish that the two embodiments in EPB with undulating walls did arise 

there as a result of Mr Ugly disclosing them in breach of confidence.  This 

would remove EPB from the state of the art under EPCa.55(1)(a), as it would 

then have been published within 6 months before the filing date of PCT1 (i.e. 

October 2005 is after 01.10.2004).  At the moment, there is little evidence that 

this is the case, and Mr Bad is right to say we would have difficulty proving 

this. 

 

There certainly seems no point in bringing entitlement proceedings for this 

aspect of EPB (EPCa.60(1)), when you would only end up with the narrow 

subject matter disclosed above in the event (not at all guaranteed) that you 

were successful (EPCa.61(1)(a)-(c)). 


 
- 12 - 

 

 

As Mr Bad will need a licence to use the undulating walls in his panels, he 

may agree to provide a declaration (if true) that the embodiments did end up 

in EPB via Mr Ugly as part of the agreement, allowing you to submit this at the 

EPO to establish EPB as not prior art under EPCa.55(1)(a).   

 

However, as the subject matter in EPB can be disclaimed from Euro-PCT 

anyway under G1/03 and G2/03 (explained above), the consequences of 

these embodiments remaining in the state of the art under EPCa.54(3) and 

(4). 

 

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you like to discuss the above at all. 

 

Yours sincerely,
