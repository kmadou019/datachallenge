Question 1 
(5 points)  

 

The Irish company HYPERTOOLS has a technical collaboration agreement with the English 

company CYBERFIT. The agreement stipulates that HYPERTOOLS and CYBERFIT are to act 

as joint applicants in respect of joint inventions made under the terms of the collaboration. 

Furthermore, since CYBERFIT is too small to have its own patent department, it is agreed that 

HYPERTOOLS will prosecute these patent applications. You are employed by HYPERTOOLS 

and have been asked to deal with inventions arising from this collaboration. However, you are 

neither a legal practitioner nor a professional representative before the EPO. Can you act 

before the EPO in respect of applications for which HYPERTOOLS and CYBERFIT are joint 

applicants? If so, what conditions must be fulfilled? 

 

 

Question 2 
(4 points)  

 

(i) 
A European patent application has been refused. An admissible appeal is filed against the 

decision to refuse the application. Is it possible to file a divisional application during 

appeal proceedings? 

 

(ii) 
What would your answer to part (i) be if the appeal fee had not been paid in due time? 

 

(iii) Is it possible to file a divisional application during the appeal proceedings related to 

opposition proceedings?

Question 3 
(7 points)  

 

A US national who made an invention while conducting technical research in Moscow filed a 

first application RU-1 in respect of that invention in Russian with the Russian Patent Office on 

7 March 2005. The US national is now a resident of Switzerland. Today, 7 March 2006, the US 

national intends to file an international application claiming the priority of RU-1. The original 

Russian text and an English translation thereof are available for filing this international 

application.  

  

What are the competent receiving Offices, and which of the two available texts can be used for 

filing the international application with the respective receiving Offices?  

 

What are the competent International Searching Authorities in respect of each of the 

competent receiving Offices?  

 

 

Question 4 
(4 points)  

 

An Austrian applicant A files an international application in German with the EPO. Before 

publication of the application, A sells this international application to company B, which is 

based in the USA. You are a European patent attorney representing company A and, after the 

purchase, company B in respect of this application.  

 

1. 
Is it possible to record the change of applicant during the international phase? Where 

does a request for recording the change have to be filed?  

 

2. 
Company B wishes the EPO to carry out the international preliminary examination. Where 

and in what language will the demand have to be filed?

Question 5  
(5 points)  

 

A European patent application EP1 designating all contracting states was filed in January 2004 

and validly claims the priority of a patent application filed in January 2003. The mention of the 

grant of the European patent based on EP1 has been published on 1 February 2006.  

 

A client wishing to oppose EP1 provides you with a European patent application EP2 

designating all contracting states. EP2 discloses the same invention as EP1 and has been 

published in September 2003. The publication of EP2 mentions a filing date of February 2003 

and a priority date of a Portuguese national patent application filed in March 2002. The 

Portuguese national patent application has been published in September 2003 and discloses 

the same invention as EP2. 

 

According to a file inspection, no copy of the priority document for EP2 has been filed. Further, 

the applicant for EP2 failed to respond to a communication pursuant to Rule 41(1) EPC dated 

July 2003 objecting to the missing copy of the priority document and setting a period of  

4 months to remedy the deficiency.  

 

Can patent EP1 be revoked on the basis of EP2?

Question 6 
(5 points)  

 

In response to a communication under Article 96(2) EPC, you, as the representative, request in 

due time a two-month extension of the time limit given in the communication on the grounds 

that the applicant is on a round-the-world sailing trip and is unable to give you any instructions 

on how to reply to the communication. This time limit extension is granted by the EPO. One day 

before the extended time limit is due to expire, you notice that the applicant has not yet 

returned from his trip, and you request a further two-month extension. The EPO refuses this 

request. You receive a communication under Rule 69(1) EPC dated 21 February 2006 due to 

failure to reply to the communication under Article 96(2) EPC. On returning from his sailing trip 

on 3 March 2006, the applicant considers that the refusal to extend the time limit was not 

justified and insists on presenting his case before the boards of appeal.  

 

1. 
What steps must be taken to have the refusal of the request for extension of the time limit 

reviewed by a board of appeal?  

 

2. 
Would you advise your client to have his case reviewed by the board of appeal?  

 

 

Question 7 
(2 points)  

 

You are representing the proprietor of a European patent at oral proceedings in an opposition 

case. The opposition division in its preliminary opinion deemed that none of the grounds 

mentioned in Article 100 EPC prejudices the maintenance of the patent as granted. However, 

the proprietor wishes the patent to be revoked. 

 

Would a request by the proprietor for revocation of the patent at these oral proceedings be 

successful?

Question 8 
(4 points)  

 
The mention of the grant of European patent EP-B has been published on 27 April 2005.  

 

On 24 January 2006 the EPO received by fax a notice of opposition filed in Italian by an Italian 

company, accompanied by a duly completed EPO debit order form 1010 ordering that the 

reduced opposition fee be debited from the company’s deposit account.   

 

On 31 January 2006 the EPO received the confirmation copy of the fax containing the notice 

of opposition. 

 

On 28 February 2006 the EPO received the English translation of the notice of opposition by 

fax.  

 

Is the opposition deemed to have been filed?  

 

 

Question 9 
(4 points)  

 

Professor Pivo from Prague (CZ), inventor of a revolutionary new beer-brewing process, files 

a Czech national application CZ-A on 3 March 2005 as a first filing, describing and claiming his 

brewing process. On 3 March 2006 he presents the process in detail in a lecture at a public 

congress in Vienna. On the same day, just before his lecture, he put a European patent 

application EP-A claiming the priority of CZ-A in the letter box of the EPO's Vienna sub-office. 

EP-A is an exact translation of CZ-A into English. EP-A is transmitted to the EPO's Munich 

office and received there on 6 March 2006.  

 

Discuss the legal situation.
