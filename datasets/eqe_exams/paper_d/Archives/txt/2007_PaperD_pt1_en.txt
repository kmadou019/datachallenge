Question 4
(6 points)

On 1 February 2005 an applicant filed a European patent application EP-1 describing 

and claiming subject-matter A. EP-1 claims priority from a German national application 

DE-1 filed on 1 March 2004. DE-1 discloses subject-matter A.

The search report mentions a German patent application DE-0 filed by the same 

applicant and disclosing subject-matter A. DE-0 was filed on 1 June 2003 and was 

withdrawn on 1 July 2004.

Due to an internal processing error of the German Patent and Trademark Office, DE-0 

was published on 1 October 2004, although the applicant had duly filed the letter 

withdrawing DE-0 in order to prevent publication of DE-0.

Does DE-0 form prior art for EP-1?
