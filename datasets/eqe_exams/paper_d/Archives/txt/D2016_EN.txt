Part I: Legal Questions 

 

QUESTION 1 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(6 POINTS) 

 

During oral proceedings on 1 July 2015 the examining division decided to refuse 

European patent application EP-A. On 16 July 2015, applicant A received a notification 

of this decision dated 14 July 2015. 

 

a) When did the time limit for filing a notice of appeal expire? 

 

On 18 September 2015 applicant A filed a notice of appeal and paid the appeal fee.  

 

Consider the following situations: 

 

b1) Applicant A withdrew the appeal on 5 October 2015 without filing a statement of 

grounds of appeal. Will the appeal fee be reimbursed? 

  

b2) On 5 October 2015 applicant A filed a statement of grounds of appeal. In February 

2016, applicant A received from the Board of Appeal a communication under Rule 

100(2) EPC. In response to the communication, applicant A immediately withdrew the 

appeal.  Will the appeal fee be reimbursed?

QUESTION 3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(7 POINTS) 

 

 

In June 2014, applicant D filed international patent application PCT-D. PCT-D was filed 

in Russian with the Russian Patent Office as the receiving Office and searched by that 

Office as International Searching Authority (ISA). PCT-D validly claims priority from an 

earlier application filed by applicant D in April 2014. Applicant D wishes to obtain a 

patent for PCT-D in The Netherlands, Lithuania and Italy as soon as possible. The 

international patent application and the international search report were published in 

October 2015. 

 

a. Applicant D asks you whether PCT-D can enter into the national phase in each of 

these countries to obtain a national patent. Please advise the applicant. 

 

b. In a letter received by the EPO today (1 March 2016), the applicant expressly 

requests the EPO to immediately start the procedure for the grant of a European patent 

in respect of PCT-D. All fees required to enter the regional phase were duly paid today. 

What has to be done to ensure that the request for early processing is effective as of 

today? 

 

c. What has to be done to ensure that the EPO starts the examination under Article 94 

EPC as soon as possible?

QUESTION 4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(9 POINTS) 

 

 

An international patent application PCT-E containing 17 claims was searched by the 

Japan Patent Office as International Searching Authority (ISA), before it duly entered 

into the European phase as EP-E.  

 

Claims 1 to 16 relate to a first invention INV1.The subject-matter of claim 16 is not 

otherwise to be found in the description or drawings of PCT-E.  

 

Independent claim 17 relates to a second invention INV2, which is not unitary with INV1. 

The subject-matter of claim 17 is disclosed in the description of PCT-E. 

 

 

a) Assume that the applicant does not want to pay any claims fees or file amended 

claims 

 

a1) On which claims will the supplementary European search be based? 

a2) Can the applicant expect a patent to be granted for EP-E including the subject-

matter of claim 16?  

a3) Can the applicant expect a patent to be granted for EP-E including the subject-

matter of claim 17?  

 

 

b) Assume that the examining division informs the applicant of the text in which it intends 

to grant EP-E. After amendments filed during examination, the text intended for grant 

contains 19 claims. Are there any claims fees to be paid?

QUESTION 5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(8 POINTS) 

 

 

Company F filed on 24 March 2014 an international patent application PCT-F in 

Japanese with the Japan Patent Office. PCT-F is directed to subject-matter F and validly 

claims priority of a Japanese patent application JP-F filed on 25 April 2013. 

 

On 25 November 2015, company F filed all documents necessary for entering the 

regional phase before the EPO. 

 

Because company F had failed to pay the filing fee pursuant to Rule 159(1)(c) EPC, the 

EPO issued a notification of loss of rights dated 15 January 2016. 

 

On 24 May 2013, company G filed European patent application EP-G with a single claim 

which is directed to subject-matter F. EP-G does not claim priority of an earlier 

application. EP-G was granted without any amendments. The mention of the grant of a 

patent for EP-G was published in the European Patent Bulletin dated 25 November 

2015. 

 

Company F wants the patent for EP-G to be revoked in view of PCT-F. 

 

Advise company F.

Part II: Legal Opinion 

 

 

[001] Today, 01 March 2016, you receive a letter from Mr Berurier, R&D manager of 

San-Antonio (SA), a coffee maker having their principal place of business in France that 

produces coffee capsules. Disposable coffee capsules are well known and very popular. 

These coffee capsules are fed to a coffee machine that pierces the coffee capsule which 

contains coffee powder. The machine feeds hot water into the coffee capsule to make 

coffee. 

 

[002] There is a problem with known coffee capsules made of plastic material because 

in the piercing step not all coffee capsules are pierced correctly and consequently the 

beverage quality is reduced. 

 

[003] We developed a plastic coffee capsule with reinforcing ribs. The ribs make the 

coffee capsule more rigid leading to a more reliable piercing step. A single rib is 

sufficient to achieve this effect. On 12 December 2014 we validly filed a French patent 

application (FR-SA) disclosing in the description a plastic coffee capsule having a rib, 

without specifying the shape of the cross section of the rib. FR-SA also discloses in the 

description a plastic coffee capsule having a rib of triangular cross section (triangular 

rib), and a plastic coffee capsule having a rib of elliptical cross section (elliptical rib). FR-

SA contains a single claim directed to a plastic coffee capsule having a rib, without 

specifying the shape of the cross section of the rib. 

 

[004] We established that coffee capsules having ribs with a cross-section which is 

triangular or elliptical can be made of any plastic material. However, it is impossible to 

produce coffee capsules having ribs of other shapes of the cross-section unless they are 

made of plastic material X. These facts are disclosed in the description of our application 

FR-SA. Material X is known by a person skilled in the art.

[005] On 14 December 2015 we validly filed a PCT patent application (PCT-SA), only 

claiming priority of FR-SA. This application includes the description and the claim of FR-

SA. 

 

[006] Our main competitor is Swiss company “Big Coffee” (BC). They sent us a warning 

letter referring to their PCT patent application, PCT-BC, published on 11 February 2016. 

PCT-BC was validly filed in German by BC on 03 August 2015. PCT-BC claims priority 

from Swiss patent application CH-BC validly filed by BC on 01 August 2014. Both PCT-

BC and CH-BC describe and claim a plastic coffee capsule having a rib and a plastic 

coffee capsule having an elliptical rib. Material X is not disclosed in CH-BC, nor is it 

disclosed in PCT-BC. In addition to the disclosure of CH-BC, PCT-BC discloses and 

claims a coffee powder containing additive G, which results in a surprisingly good coffee 

because the aromas are extracted very well. G is a known stabilizer for cosmetics. The 

search report for PCT-BC covers all claims and mentions no relevant prior art. 

 

[007] We are very upset because PCT-BC, not only claims a coffee capsule with a rib, 

but also claims coffee powder containing additive G. Coffee powder containing additive 

G was already disclosed and claimed in our French patent application FR1-SA, which 

was validly filed on 10 June 2013. FR1-SA was withdrawn in August 2013 without 

leaving any rights outstanding and without having served as a basis for claiming a right 

of priority. On 12 December 2014, we validly filed a French patent application FR2-SA, 

having the same description and claims as FR1-SA. 

 

[008] Luckily enough we included the description of FR2-SA also into our PCT-SA, so 

we assume that we have no problem with PCT-BC. The search report for FR2-SA does 

not mention relevant prior art.

[009] We have another concern with regard to Big Coffee. They have a European 

patent, EP1-BC granted in May 2012. The patent has a single claim relating to coffee 

capsules made of material X. No mention of ribs is made in EP1-BC. We have filed an 

opposition against EP1-BC on the ground of lack of novelty over common general 

knowledge, because material X was already widely used for packaging food. 

 

[010] The opposition was rejected with a decision dated 30 December 2015 which was 

received on 05 January 2016. After the notification of the decision, our professional 

representative before the EPO, who is Dutch and has represented us so far in this 

matter, found a document D. D was published two years before the date of filing of EP1-

BC and discloses coffee capsules made of material X, without mentioning ribs. Before 

leaving for an expedition to the South Pole, he sent us a copy of this document and filed 

a notice of appeal in Dutch. The appeal fee was paid.   

 

 

Please let us know: 

 

1. What is the patent situation as it currently stands  with respect to  

a- plastic coffee capsules having an elliptical rib, 

b- plastic coffee capsules having a triangular rib,  

c- plastic coffee capsules having a rib,  

d- plastic coffee capsules made of material X, 

e- coffee powder containing additive G? 

 

2. What actions can we take to improve our situation with regard to each of the 

above products? 

 

3. After having taken these actions, can Big Coffee stop us from selling any of the 

above products in Europe, or can we stop Big Coffee from selling any of the 

above products in Europe?
