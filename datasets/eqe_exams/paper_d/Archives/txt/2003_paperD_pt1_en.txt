Question 1 
(4 points)  

 

The examining division decided to refuse a European patent application. The decision 

dated 06.12.2002 was sent by the EPO to the representative of the applicant without a 

written communication of the possibility of appeal. 

 
On 06.03.2003, the applicant instructs his representative to file an appeal. 

 
Would such an appeal be admissible? 

 

 

Question 2 
(4 points)  

 

(a) Applicant X filed a European patent application EP1. On 27.12.2002, the applicant 

pays the fees for grant and printing, and files the translation of the claims in accordance 

with Rule 51(4) EPC. On 02.01.2003, X would like to file a divisional application relating 

to EP1. Is this possible? 

 
(b) Applicant X filed a European patent application EP2. On 23.04.2003 the mention of 

the grant of the European patent will be published. Until when can a divisional 

application relating to EP2 be filed? 

 
(c) 
Opposition proceedings related to European patent EP3 are pending. Is it possible 

to file a divisional application relating to EP3?

Question 3 
(4 points)  

 

An appeal was validly lodged by the sole appellant (opponent) against the decision of 

the opposition division to maintain the patent in amended form. 

 
On 11.03.2003, at 16:09 hrs, a telefax was received by the EPO from the sole appellant 

withdrawing his appeal. On the same day, at 20:12 hrs, the EPO received a telefax from 

a third party filing a notice of intervention according to Article 105 EPC together with the 

order to deduct the opposition and the appeal fees from their deposit account. On 

18.03.2003 the EPO duly received the confirmation of both telefax letters. 

 
What is the legal situation? 

 

 

Question 4 
(6 points)  

 

A Spanish client, who has filed an opposition to a European patent, asks you to 

represent him during opposition proceedings before the EPO. Today, 26.03.2003, you 

receive the file and notice the following: 

 
- 
The mention of the grant of the patent was published on 19.06.2002. The 

opposition was filed with the EPO in Spanish by telefax on 14.03.2003. 

 
- 
The amount of EUR 488 with respect to this opposition was entered into the bank 

account held by the EPO  on 20.03.2003. The order for the transfer was duly given to a 

Spanish bank on the same day the telefax was sent. 

 
Which steps are necessary in order to ensure that the opposition is validly filed?

Question 5 
(5 points)  

 

Today, 26.03.2003, your Japanese client asks you to enter the regional phase before 

the EPO for a PCT-application filed in Japanese with the Japanese Patent Office on 

28.08.2001, validly claiming priority from a Japanese patent application dated 

28.08.2000. The International Preliminary Examination was carried out by the Japanese 

Patent Office. 

 
Due to an overload of work in the translation department of your client, you are informed 

that you will receive the English translation of the PCT-application on 15.04.2003. 

 
How would you proceed in order to enter the regional phase, keeping costs for your 

client to a minimum? 

 

 

Question 6 
(4 points)  

 

Mr. A produced toys made of a plastic material P. His competitor B was granted a 

European patent with two claims, claim 1 for the composition of P and claim 2 for a 

method of producing P. 

 
Mr. A filed a valid opposition against B's patent. This opposition is pending. Because Mr. 

A has always bought P, and was not interested in methods for producing P, the extent of 

the opposition was limited to claim 1. 

 
There is no further opposition and the time limit for filing an opposition has expired. 

 
Mr. A died during the opposition proceedings. 

 
Can his sole heir Mr. H become a party to the opposition proceedings? 

 
If so, can the opposition be extended to cover the method of producing P?

Question 7 
(4 points)  

 

You are in receipt of a decision of a Board of Appeal, refusing your Portuguese client's 

European patent application designating all Contracting States. The application had 

been filed without claiming priority. When informing your client about the decision, he 

asks you whether he could still obtain protection for the subject-matter of this application 

in Portugal. 

 
Which steps do you propose? 

 

 

Question 8 
(5 points)  

 

By a final decision of a national court dated 11.02.2003, it was adjudged that your client 

is entitled to the grant of a European patent on the basis of a European patent 

application A filed by a third party. Your client intends to file a new European patent 

application in respect of the invention of application A. 

 
a) 
If application A is pending: 

 
i) 
Would your client be allowed to include some further embodiments of his 

invention in this new European patent application? 

 
ii) 
Would your client have to pay renewal fees in respect of the year in which 

the new European patent application is filed and any preceding year?  

 
(b) 
If application A is no longer pending: 

 
 
Would your client still be entitled to file a new European patent application?

Question 9 
(6 points)  

 

Dr. Feelgood filed a PCT-application with the EPO without claiming priority. The sole 

independent claim is directed to a method in which an implant is inserted into the heart 

of a patient. The implant itself is disclosed in the description and is considered to be new 

and revolutionary by Dr. Feelgood.  

 
Yesterday Dr. Feelgood received a declaration in accordance with Article 17(2)(a)(i) PCT.  

 
Dr. Feelgood would like you to inform him:  

 
a) 
whether, in accordance with the PCT or the EPC, he is entitled to a partial or 

complete reimbursement of the international search fee; and 

 
b) 
whether and how he could obtain a European patent on the basis of his 

application?  

 

 

Question 10 
(3 points) 

 

A Dutch company validly filed a first national patent application in Thailand. 

 
Would it be possible for them to validly claim the priority of this application in a 

subsequent PCT-application?
