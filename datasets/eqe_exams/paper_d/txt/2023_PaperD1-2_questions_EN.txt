QUESTION 4
(7 MARKS)

European patent EP-E was assigned from company E to company F. The transfer of 

ownership was recorded in the European Patent Register in November 2022. EP-E 

was revoked by a written decision of the opposition division issued on 

19 December 2022.

In February 2023 you received an email from company F instructing you to file an 

appeal on its behalf. On 28 February 2023 you filed notice of appeal and paid the 

appeal fee.

Today, you realise that the notice of appeal was erroneously filed in the name of 

company E, rather than in the name of company F.

(a) What is the current status regarding the admissibility of the appeal?

(b) How can you improve the situation?

QUESTION 5
(11 MARKS)

On 2 December 2022 Portuguese applicant G filed international patent application 

PCT-G in English with the Portuguese Patent Office (INPI).

By invitation dated 9 December 2022, INPI invited G to file an abstract. Despite taking all

due care, G filed the missing abstract with INPI only on 3 March 2023.

Yesterday, G received a notification from INPI declaring PCT-G withdrawn.

(a) Why was PCT-G declared withdrawn? What will be the legal consequence of this 

withdrawal in the designated states of PCT-G if nothing is done?

(b) Applicant G wants to revive PCT-G before the EPO. What procedural steps must 

applicant G carry out?

QUESTION 6
(10 MARKS)

European patent application EP-H describes a product P, a method only resulting in 

product P and a particular use of product P as a fertiliser to enhance plant growth.

EP-H was granted with a single claim to product P.

Opposition was validly filed against EP-H based on the ground of lack of novelty. The 

opponent cited EP-J, a document under Article 54(3) EPC that discloses the same 

product P, wherein P is obtained by a different method, and the use of product P as a 

detergent.

(a) How should EP-H be amended to provide the maximum scope of protection? Give

reasons why EP-H as amended meets the requirements of Articles 123 and 

54 EPC.

(b) How would your answer to (a) change if EP-H described product P for use as a 

medicament rather than describing the use of product P as a fertiliser?
