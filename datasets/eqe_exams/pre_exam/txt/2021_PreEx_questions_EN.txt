Part 3 of Pre-examination 2021 
 
 

Description of a European patent application (date of filing: 31 

March 2019) 

 
 
Title: Glass compositions for use as a photochromic lens 
 
 

[01] The present invention relates to a glass composition for use as a 

photochromic lens. 

[02] Photochromic lenses are used in eye-glasses. Photochromic 

lenses change colour depending on the amount of light present. In 

low-light conditions, such as inside, a photochromic lens will be 

substantially colourless. In conditions with increased light levels, 

such as outside, the photochromic lens darkens. The change in 

colour is a result of components in the photochromic lens which 

react with ultraviolet (UV) light. 

[03] Photochromic lenses currently in use also change colour 

depending on the temperature of the surroundings. For example, in 

the cold, the colour change is enhanced and the photochromic 

lenses become much darker in colour. In warmer temperatures the 

colour change is less apparent, thus providing sub-optimal eye 

protection from harmful UV light. 

[04] The present invention relates to an improved glass composition for 

use as a photochromic lens. 

[05] The glass composition of the invention comprises silicon dioxide, 

component A, component M and component X. 


2021/P/EN/18
 

[06] Component A is used to lower the melting temperature of the glass 

composition. Preferably, component A is present in the composition 

in a content of about 10% to about 30% by weight, for example 

10% to 20% by weight. Most preferably, component A is present in 

the composition in a content of 16% by weight. 

[07] Preferably, component A is selected from the group consisting of 

sodium oxide, sodium carbonate and boron trioxide. Most 

preferably, component A is sodium oxide. 

[08] Component A reduces the melting temperature of silicon dioxide 

and reduces costs, but the resulting glass composition, which 

contains silicon dioxide and component A, is water-soluble and 

unstable which makes it unsuitable for use as a lens. 

[09] Component M reduces the water-solubility and improves the 

stability of the glass composition, but only if it is present in certain 

amounts, otherwise component M has detrimental effects. The 

content of component M must be about 5% to about 10% by weight 

of the glass composition. If the content of component M is less 

than 5% by weight of the glass composition, the glass composition 

is not stable enough for use. If the content is greater than 10% by 

weight of the glass composition, the glass composition solidifies at 

high temperatures which makes it unusable. 

[10] Preferably, component M is selected from the group consisting of 

lime, zinc oxide and alumina. 

[11] Component X provides the photochromic characteristics of the 

glass composition. Component X is a molecule which upon 

exposure to light, reacts reversibly with itself and absorbs UV light. 

Component X provides improved resistance to colour change as a 


2021/P/EN/19
 

result of a change in temperature. Preferably, component X is 

selected from compound alpha, compound beta and compound 

gamma, which are all similarly effective at absorbing UV light. 

[12] Compound alpha, surprisingly, provides a photochromic lens that is 

the most resistant to colour changes as a result of a change in 

temperature. 

[13] Therefore, most preferably, component X is compound alpha. 
 
[14] Component X may be present in a content of 10% by weight of the 

composition. 

[15] The invention also provides a process for manufacturing a 

photochromic lens from the glass composition of the invention, 

which comprises the following steps: 

(i) mixing components A and M together in a first vessel to obtain a 

first mixture; 

(ii) heating silicon dioxide in a second vessel to a high temperature; 
 

(iii) adding the first mixture from step (i) to the second vessel from 

step (ii) to form a second mixture; 

(iv) adding component X to the second mixture; 
 

(v) forming a photochromic lens; and afterwards 
 

(vi) allowing the photochromic lens to cool to a low temperature. 
 
[16] Preferably, the silicon dioxide is heated to about 1500 °C, about 

1600 °C, about 1700 °C or about 1800 °C. Most preferably, the 

silicon dioxide is heated to 1675 °C. 


2021/P/EN/20
 

[17] The combination of steps in the above-mentioned process results 

in a photochromic lens which changes colour from colourless to 

red upon exposure to UV light. 

[18] The invention also provides a photochromic lens obtainable by the 

above-mentioned process.

For each of the statements 15.1 to 15.4, indicate on the answer sheet 

whether the statement is true or false. 

 
 
15.1 D2 can be considered to be the closest prior art for claim III-3 

because it relates to the same technical field, i.e. the field of 

photochromic lenses. 

 
 
15.2 The objective technical problem to be solved by the subject-matter 

of claim III-1 with respect to D2 is the provision of a photochromic 

lens, the colour change of which is resistant to temperature 

changes. 

 
 
15.3 A valid argument for why the subject-matter of claim III-1 has an 

inventive step over D2 is because using compound alpha as 

component X results in a photochromic lens, the colour of which is 

surprisingly more resistant to temperature changes than when 

compound beta or compound gamma is used. 

 
 
15.4 A combination of D2 and D3 could be used to validly attack claim 

III-1 for lack of inventive step.

Part 4 of Pre-examination 2021 
 
 

Description of a second European patent application 
 
Client application (with originally filed claims) 
 
 
[01] The present invention relates to a protection device for a tablet 

computer. 
 
[02] Tablet computers are well known. A tablet computer is a mobile 

device with a touch sensitive screen. The computer elements are 

integrated into the back of the screen. The size of the screen is 

usually from 7 inches to 19 inches so that the device can be easily 

handled. 

 
[03] The present invention provides a protection device comprising a 

receiving part for receiving the tablet computer and a cover part for 

protecting the screen of the tablet computer. The receiving part is 

made of a structure comprising a flat base and four elastically 

deformable corners extending from the peripheral edge of the 

base. The elastically deformable corners secure the tablet 

computer within the receiving part. Preferably, the corners are 

made of silicone having a greater thickness than the base, while 

the base is made of a rigid plastic. Silicone is expensive and 

having silicone only in the corners is not only cost effective but also 

environmentally friendly due to the reduction of material used, 

whilst only slightly decreasing the protection of the tablet computer 

if it is dropped. 


2021/P/EN/35
 

[04] In a first embodiment, the cover part is flat and rigid and made of 

an inexpensive plastic. It has been shown that when the cover part 

is flat and at the same time rigid, the screen of the tablet is better 

protected. The cover part is joined to a side of the receiving part by 

a hinge which is attached to both the base of the receiving part and 

to the cover part. The hinge, the cover part and the base of the 

receiving part may be made from the same material such that the 

hinge is formed by a fold. The cover part is large enough to cover 

the screen after insertion of the tablet computer into the receiving 

part. 
 
[05] In an alternative second embodiment shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, 

the cover part (10) is divided into three sections (11a, 11b, 11c) 

which are joined to each other by hinges (12a, 12b) parallel to the 

hinge (13) joining the cover part (10) and the receiving part (14). 

The receiving part (14) comprises a flat base (not shown) and four 

elastically deformable corners (16). Each section (11a, 11b, 11c) is 

flat and rigid. The hinges (12a, 12b) and the sections (11a, 11b, 

11c) may be made from the same material such that the hinges 

(12a, 12b) are formed by folds of the cover part (10) as shown in 

Fig.1. When the hinges (12a, 12b) and the sections (11a, 11b, 11c) 

are made from the same material, the material at the hinges (12a, 

12b) may preferably be thinner than the material at the sections 

(11a, 11b, 11c), allowing the material to fold more easily. 

Alternatively, the hinges (12a, 12b) can be separate parts made of 

a different material from the sections. Regardless of the material 

used, in this embodiment, the cover part (10) may be folded into a 

triangular prism shape (15) serving as an inclined support for the 

receiving part holding the tablet computer, as shown in Fig. 2.

Document D1 (state of the art according Article 54(2) EPC) 
 
[01] D1 discloses a shipping box for packaging and protecting a tablet 

computer. The shipping box comprises a flat base and four walls 

for receiving the tablet computer. The shipping box comprises four 

flaps extending respectively from each of the four walls. The flaps 

can be folded over and secured to each other to close the shipping 

box and fully cover the tablet, i.e. the shipping box forms a closed 

box. The shipping box can be made of rigid material such as 

cardboard or polymer reinforced cardboard. 

 
 
[02] A frame is included inside the shipping box for holding the tablet 

computer in place in the shipping box. The frame is made of an 

elastically deformable material so that the tablet computer can be 

held tightly therein. 


2021/P/EN/41
 

Document D2 (state of the art according Article 54(2) EPC) 
 
[01] D2 discloses a protection device for a tablet computer. The 

protection device comprises a receiving part and a cover part. The 

cover part is joined to the receiving part by a hinge so that the 

cover part protects the screen of the tablet computer. 

[02] The receiving part has a flat base and a peripheral wall. The 

peripheral wall extends along the entire periphery of the base. The 

receiving part is made from a single piece of silicone having a 

uniform thickness. Both the flat base and the peripheral wall 

deform elastically for receiving and securing the tablet computer in 

the receiving part. After insertion, the tablet computer is held tightly 

by the peripheral wall (110 of Fig. 3). 

[03] For better protection of the screen of the tablet computer, it is 

possible to increase the thickness of the silicone material of the 

whole receiving part uniformly. 

[04] As shown in Fig. 3, the cover part (100) is divided into three flat 

and rigid parallel sections which are joined to each other by hinges. 

These sections can be folded into a triangular prism shape serving 

as an inclined support for the receiving part holding the tablet 

computer (20).
