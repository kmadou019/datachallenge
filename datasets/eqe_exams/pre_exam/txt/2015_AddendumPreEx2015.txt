 
Addendum to EQE Pre-examination 2015 
 
 
 
Statements 15.2 and 17.3 
Since it can be argued (as it was done in some appeals) that the disclosure of D1 
may not be sufficient for the candidate to conclude that cardboard generally 
comprises wood fibres, it was decided to award marks also for the answer “True” in 
statement 15.2 and for the answer “False” in statement 17.3 to the appellants (Art. 
24(3) of the Regulation on the EQE for professional representatives). In addition, 
also candidates who did not file an appeal on this issue but in the light of these 
considerations would have passed, were upgraded and were informed accordingly.
