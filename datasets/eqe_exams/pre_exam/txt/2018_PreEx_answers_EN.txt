EXAMINERS’ REPORT PRE-EXAMINATION 2018 

 

 

Question 1 

 

Under Article 123(2) EPC, it is not allowable to add matter to a European 

patent present only in the priority document for that patent, Guidelines,  

H-IV 2.2.5. [Note that there is an exception under Rule 56(3) EPC]. 

Intermediate generalisations may be allowable under specific circumstances, 

see Guidelines, H-V 3.2.1. The abstract may not be taken into account for any 

purpose other than for technical information, Article 85 EPC. Subject-matter 

present only in claims filed after the date of filing (as is the case for claims 

filed in reply to a communication under Rule 58 in conjunction with Rule 57(c) 

EPC) goes beyond the subject-matter of the application as filed (description 

and drawings), see also Guidelines, H-IV 2.2.3. 

 

1.1 – False 

1.2 – False 

1.3 – False 

1.4 – False  

 

 

Question 2 

 

If Daniela ignores the invitation, then any reference to the drawings will be 

deemed to be deleted, Rule 56(4)(a) EPC (the legal consequence is not that 

the application is deemed to be withdrawn). If the missing drawings are filed 

within two months of the notification of that communication [22 February + 10 

days (4 March 2018) + 2 months], i.e. 4 May 2018 (Rule 56(1) EPC, 

Rule 126(2) EPC, Rule 131(4) EPC) the application shall be re-dated to the 

date on which the missing drawings were filed, Rule 56(2) EPC. According to 

Rule 135(2) EPC, further processing is ruled out in respect of the period under 

Rule 56(2) EPC. An applicant may file missing parts of the description or 

Page 1 of 18


missing drawings of his own motion within two months of the date of filing, 

Rule 56(2) EPC and Guidelines, A-II 5.2.  

 

2.1 – False 

2.2 – True 

2.3 – False 

2.4 – True 

 

 

Question 3 

 

The validity of the priority right as such is not a ground for opposition, since it 

is not mentioned in Article 100 EPC. If the priority of EP-A is not valid, then 

the effective date of EP-A in accordance with Article 89 EPC is the filing date 

of EP-A (29 February 2016). In such a case, FR-B is state of the art according 

to Article 54(2) EPC, and it can be used to attack novelty (and inventive step) 

of EP-A. The national application FR-B can only be prior art under 

Article 54(2) EPC and not under Article 54(3) EPC. Lack of novelty and lack of 

sufficiency of disclosure are separate grounds for opposition, Article 100 EPC. 

Moreover, the objection of lack of sufficiency of disclosure was raised after the 

expiration of the opposition period (see G10/91 and Guidelines, D-V, 2.2). 

Thus, the objection of lack of sufficiency is considered to be a fresh ground for 

opposition. 

 

3.1 – True 

3.2 – True 

3.3 – False 

3.4 – True 

 

 

Question 4 

 

The time limit for replying to the communication under Rule 71(3) EPC expires 

on [22 October 2017 + 10 days (1 November 2017) + 4 months] 1 March 2018 

Page 2 of 18


(Rule 71(3) EPC, Rule 126(2) EPC and Rule 131(4) EPC). If the applicant 

pays the fee for grant and publishing and files the required translation of the 

claims, then this is considered to be an approval of the text, Rule 71(5) EPC. 

An appeal against the decision to grant would be an appeal of a not adversely 

affected party. The applicant can disagree to the text proposed, provided he 

requests reasoned amendments (Rule 71(6) EPC). The examining division 

may not resume the examination proceedings (cf. GL edition 2016 C-V, 4.7)  

and consequently may not consider third party observations after the decision 

to grant has been handed over to the EPO's internal postal service, Rule 

71a(2) EPC, see also G12/91 and GL edition 2016 E-V, 3. In the present case 

of statement 4.4, the applicant has already received the decision to grant and 

therefore it is correct to answer “true”. In view of arguments raised on appeal 

the examining division responsible for issuing a technical opinion under Article 

25 EPC may consider third party observations, which were filed after 

notification of the decision to grant. On account of this rare possibility the 

statement 4.4 has been neutralised and marks are awarded for both answers. 

 

4.1 - True 

4.2 - False 

4.3 - True 

4.4 - True or False 

 

 

Question 5 

 

The renewal fee for the third year of the European patent application 

stemming from PCT-E are only due on 31 July 2018 (Rule 159(1)(g) EPC, 

Article 86(1) EPC, Rule 51(1) EPC). The time limit for entry into the European 

phase expires on [29 July 2015 + 31 months =] 28 February 2018, 

Rule 159(1) EPC and Rule 131(4) EPC). According to Rule 159(1)(c) EPC, 

the filing fee must be paid on entry into the European phase. Hence, for 

validly entering the European phase today, it is necessary to pay the filing fee. 

In view of arguments raised on appeal it appears that the statement 5.3 could 

be understood as referring to the concept of “entry” versus “early entry” into 

Page 3 of 18


the European phase with regard to 26 February 2018. This would additionally 

require the lifting of the processing ban before the 31-month time limit has 

expired by filing a request for early entry (cf. GL E-IX, 2.8 and OJ EPO 213, 

156). Thus in view of this interpretation it was decided to neutralise the 

statement 5.3 and award marks for both answers. According to Rule 159(1)(f) 

EPC and Rule 70(1) EPC, the request for examination must be filed up to six 

months after the date on which the European search report is published in the 

European Patent Bulletin: the international publication of the search report 

takes the place of the European search report and the mention of its 

publication in the European Patent Bulletin, Article 153(6) EPC (see also GL 

C-II, 1.2). The request for examination may be filed until May 2018 

(November 2017 + 6 months).  

 

5.1 – False 

5.2 – False 

5.3 – True or False 

5.4 – False  

 

Question 6 

 

Where no priority is claimed, the translation of an international application has 

to be supplied within thirty-one months from the date of filing, i.e. sometime in 

March 2018. If the translation is not filed in due time, the European patent 

application is deemed to be withdrawn (Rule 160(1) and (2) EPC), and further 

processing can be requested, Article 121(1) EPC and Rule 135(1) EPC. In 

proceedings before the EPO, Juana must be represented by a professional 

representative, Article 133(2) EPC. Juana is not entitled to a reduction of the 

examination fee, since she is neither resident in nor a national of a contracting 

state of the EPC, Rule 6(4) EPC and Article 14(4) EPC.  

 

6.1 – False 

6.2 – True 

6.3 – True 

6.4 – False  

Page 4 of 18


Question 7 

 

Any infringement of a European patent is dealt with by national law, 

Article 64(3) EPC. A patent gives the patent proprietor the right to exclude 

third parties from using the protected invention: it does not automatically allow 

the patent proprietor to produce and sell matter that is protected by the patent. 

The obligation to pay renewal fees to the EPO terminates in 2017, with the 

payment of the renewal fee due in respect of the year in which the mention of 

the grant of the European patent is published in the European Patent Bulletin, 

Article 86(2) EPC.  

 

7.1 - False 

7.2 - False 

7.3 - False 

7.4 - True 

 

 

Question 8 

 

The EPO has acted as the International Searching Authority. The EPO will, 

among others, invite the applicant to amend the description and claims in 

accordance with Rule 161(1) EPC soon after Euro-PCT-M enters the 

European phase. Any amendment or comment can be filed within six months 

of that communication. If in the application documents which are to serve as 

the basis of the examination an invention is claimed that was not searched by 

the EPO as the International Searching authority, the applicant will be invited 

to pay further search fees in respect of any such invention, Rule 164(2)(a) 

EPC. The present set of claims includes at present 35 claims, and therefore 

claims fees are due in accordance with Rule 162(1) EPC: however, the legal 

consequence of not paying claims fees for some claims is that these claims 

shall be deemed to be abandoned, Rule 162 (4) EPC. The application is not  

 
 

Page 5 of 18


deemed to be withdrawn, if the applicant fails to comment today, since he may 

do so within the period set in accordance with Rule 161(1) EPC.  

 

8.1 - True 

8.2 - True 

8.3 - False 

8.4 - False 

 

 

Question 9  

 

The statement setting out the grounds for the appeal must be filed at the latest 

on 16 April 2018 [6 December 2017 + 10 days (Rule 126(2) EPC) + 4 months 

(Article 108 EPC and Rule 131(4) EPC) = 16 April 2018]. An application is 

pending if it was refused and if no appeal has yet been filed until the expiry of 

the time limit for filing the notice of appeal [6 December 2017 + 10 days 

(Rule 126(2) EPC) + 2 months (Article 108 EPC and Rule 131(4) EPC) = 

16 February 2018], see also G1/09. An interlocutory revision is never possible 

on the basis of an auxiliary request, even if it would overcome the grounds for 

refusal, Guidelines, E-XI, 7.4.3. If interlocutory revision is to be granted, the 

applicant must address convincingly all grounds for refusal, i.e. novelty over 

D1 and inventive step over D2.  

 

9.1 – False 

9.2 – True 

9.3 – False 

9.4 – False 

 

 

Question 10 

 

A decision (such as a decision to refuse a patent application) may not be 

based on facts and evidence (such as a new document) on which the 

applicant did not have the opportunity to be heard, Article 113(1) EPC and 

Page 6 of 18


G4/92. The examining division can exercise the discretion not to admit 

requests filed during prosecution of the application, such as after summons to 

oral proceedings have been issued. However, the discretion is exercised 

under Rule 137(3) EPC (see also Guidelines, H-II, 2.7.1), since the time frame 

for filing amendments in respect of EP-S under Rule 116(1) and (2) EPC was 

still open. The examining division may hold oral proceedings in the absence of 

the party duly summoned, Rule 115(2) EPC. The examining division has three 

technically qualified examiners, Article 18(2) EPC.  

 

10.1 – False 

10.2 – False 

10.3 – True  

10.4 – False  

 

 

Question 11 

 

11.1 – False: Claim I.1 claims a jug, while the application describes in the 

final paragraph [015] of the application one embodiment where the lid is 

mounted on a filter carrier which is separate from a jug on which it may be 

mounted. Furthermore, paragraph [014] refers to an alternative detector 

having submergible electrodes which does not increment in response to the 

movement of the blocking mechanism. Thus, there are embodiments of the 

application not covered by subject-matter of claim I.1. 

 

11.2 – True: The description of D1 in paragraph [003] makes clear that the 

flap 105 is slid to open or close the aperture 104 and when in the open 

position flap 105 contacts the detector 116. The last sentence of this 

paragraph explicitly states that the incrementation results from the movement 

from the closed position to the open position. The first embodiment of D1 does 

not disclose the characterising feature of claim I.1 namely “a counter 

configured to automatically increment in response to said blocking mechanism 

moving from an open to a closed position”. 

 

Page 7 of 18


11.3 – False: The second embodiment of document D1 shows jug (101) for 

filtering water, comprising: a lid (103), an aperture (104) provided through said 

lid (103); a blocking mechanism (flap 105) mounted on the lid (103) at the 

aperture (104) and displaceable between a closed position, in which it closes 

said aperture, and an open position; a counter configured to automatically 

increment in response to said blocking mechanism moving from an open to a 

closed position (paragraph 4), wherein said blocking mechanism (flap 105) is 

pivotable in an anti-clockwise direction between said closed and said open 

position. Although Figure 2 shows the flap pivoting in a clockwise direction, it 

is clear that the jug disclosed in the second embodiment can be viewed from 

the other direction as indeed the jug of Figure 1 is, in which case the flap will 

pivot in an anti-clockwise direction. This is also explained in paragraph [007] 

of the description of the application. The feature “anti-clockwise direction” 

does not limit the scope of claim I.2, since this direction depends on the 

orientation of the jug with respect to the observer. Thus, the subject-matter of 

claim I.2 is not novel over the second embodiment of document D1. 

 

11.4 – True: The second embodiment of document D2 shows a jug (201) for 

filtering water, comprising: a lid (203), an aperture (204) provided through said 

lid (203); but no blocking mechanism displaceable between a closed position, 

in which it closes said aperture, and an open position (see paragraph [010], 

last sentence of D2). Thus, the subject-matter of claim I.1 is novel over the 

second embodiment of document D2. 

 

 

Question 12 

 

12.1 – True: The second embodiment of document D2 shows a jug (201) for 

filtering water, comprising: a lid (203), an aperture (204) provided through said 

lid (203); but no blocking mechanism displaceable between a closed position, 

in which it closes said aperture, and an open position (see paragraph [010], 

last sentence of D2).Thus, claim II.1 is novel over the second embodiment 

document D2.  

 

Page 8 of 18


12.2 – See below: The third embodiment of document D1 discloses a 

jug (101) for filtering water, comprising: a lid (103), an aperture (104) provided 

through said lid (103); a blocking mechanism (flap 105) mounted on the 

lid (103) at the aperture (104) and displaceable between a closed position, in 

which it closes said aperture, and an open position. The third embodiment of 

D1 discloses a counter, but not a counter configured to automatically 

increment in response to water being added to the jug. Strictly, the counter 

should be mentioned in the preamble of claim II.1. Nevertheless, it is possible 

to consider the counter being automatically incremented as a single feature, 

so that the present two-part form would also be correct. For this reason it was 

exceptionally decided to award marks for both answers. 

 

 

12.3 – False: The characterising feature of claim II.1 is disclosed in the first 

embodiment of document D2 namely a counter (211) configured to 

automatically increment in response to water being added to the jug (see 

paragraph 8 of D2). Thus, the two part form is not correct with respect to the 

first embodiment document D2. 

 

12.4 – See below: The wording of claim II.1 is such that the subject-matter is 

claimed as a result to be achieved. In effect claim II.1 claims a solution to the 

underlying technical problem without providing technical details of the 

essential features required to achieve this. As a general rule, claims which 

attempt to define the invention by a result to be achieved should not be 

allowed, in particular if they only amount to claiming the underlying technical 

problem. The technical features that provide the solution to the technical 

problem should be included in the independent claim. Since claim II.1 misses 

at least the definition of a detector, claim II.1 does not meet the requirements 

of Article 84, see Guidelines F IV 4.10 and the answer to 12.4 is “True”. 

However, the answer to statement 12.4 was perceived to be quite difficult in 

the frame of the pre-examination and it was decided to award marks for both 

answers. 

 

 

Page 9 of 18


Question 13 

 

13.1 –See below: The application does not explicitly disclose an embodiment 

with both a detector operable to detect a flap moving and one detecting a 

level of a liquid. Nevertheless, since this subject-matter is disclosed in the 

dependent claims, i.e. in the application as filed, it is permissible to amend the 

description so that it includes this subject-matter (Guidelines F-IV, 6.6). In 

view of these arguments both possible answers are considered to be correct. 

For this reason it was exceptionally decided to award marks for both answers.  

 

13.2 – False: The first embodiment of document D2 discloses a jug (201) for 

filtering water, comprising: a lid (203), an aperture (duct 204) provided through 

said lid (203); a blocking mechanism (blade 213a and guide 214; paragraph 

[009] of D2) mounted on the lid (203) at the aperture (204) and displaceable 

between a closed position, in which it closes said aperture (204), and an open 

position; comprising a counter configured to automatically increment in 

response to water being added to the jug and further comprising a detector 

configured to detect said blocking mechanism moving from said open to said 

closed position, said counter configured to increment in response to a signal 

received from said detector (see paragraph [009], signal transmitted each time 

flexible guide 214 contacts turbine blade 213a and thereby closes 

aperture 204). Thus, subject-matter of claim II.2 is not novel over the first 

embodiment of document D2. 

 

13.3 – True: The first embodiment of document D2 does not disclose biasing 

means associated with said blocking mechanism (turbine blade 213a and 

flexible guide 214) for biasing said blocking mechanism towards said closed 

position. Although the guide 214 is flexible, the turbine rotates and comes to 

rest in any position, and has no biasing means to urge it to towards contacting 

the flexible guide. Thus, the subject-matter of claim II.4 is novel over the first 

embodiment of document D2. 

 

13.4 – True: The first embodiment of the application comprises a jug (1) for 

filtering water, comprising: a lid (3), an aperture (4) provided through said 

Page 10 of 18


lid (3); a blocking mechanism (5) mounted on the lid (3) at the aperture (4) 

and displaceable between a closed position, in which it closes said aperture, 

and an open position; a counter configured to automatically increment in 

response to water being added to the jug; and a detector (12) configured to 

detect said blocking mechanism moving from said open to said closed 

position, said counter configured to increment in response to a signal received 

from said detector (paragraph [012] of the application). Thus, the first 

embodiment is covered by the scope of claim II.2.  

 

 

Question 14 

 

14.1 – True: There is basis in the application for both reaching and exceeding 

a predetermined level (see paragraph [014] of the application). 

 

14.2 – False: The second embodiment of document D1 discloses a jug (101) 

for filtering water, comprising: a lid (103), an aperture (104) provided through 

said lid (103); a blocking mechanism (105) mounted on the lid (103) at the 

aperture (104) and displaceable between a closed position, in which it closes 

said aperture, and an open position; a detector (116) for detecting water being 

added to the jug; a counter (111) configured to increment in response to said 

detector detecting water being added to said jug; wherein said detector is 

configured to detect water being added to the jug by detecting said blocking 

mechanism moving from said open to said closed position (see paragraph 

[004] disclosing the second embodiment of D1, since the movement of the 

blocking mechanism is suitable for detecting water being added, GL F-IV, 

4.13). Thus, the subject-matter of claim III.2 is not novel over D1. 

 

14.3 – True: The feature of the counter being configured to increment in 

response to a signal received from said detector can be deleted from claim 

III.2 as it is now present in amendment claim III.1 from which claim III.2 

depends. The features of amended claim III.2 correspond to the features of 

claim II.2 (as both include the feature of the independent claim from which 

they depend). 

Page 11 of 18


 

14.4 – True: Document D2 does not disclose “a detector configured to detect 

a level of water within said jug reaching a predetermined level”, in D2 an 

amount of water added to a jug is automatically detected using a turbine. 

There is no disclosure of detecting a water level and thus, the subject-matter 

of claim III.3 is novel over document D2. 

 

 

Question 15 

 

15.1 – False: The application as filed discloses water and conductive liquid, 

but not liquid in general (see paragraph [014]). Thus, there is no basis for this 

generalisation and claim III.1 with such an amendment would not meet the 

requirements of Article 123(2). 

 

15.2 – False: The application as filed does not mention a turbine. Only 

document D2 mentions a turbine. Document D2 is neither a document 

according to the state of the art under Article 54(3) nor can the disclosure of 

document D2 be viewed as an accidental anticipation of claim III.1, and nor 

can a turbine be considered to be non-technical (see G1/03 and G2/03). Thus, 

a disclaimer excluding this feature would not be allowable under 

Article 123(2). 

 

15.3 – False: The third embodiment of the application detects water being 

added to the jug by detecting a rise in the water level within the jug, not by 

detecting movement of the blocking means. Thus, the third embodiment of the 

application is not covered by the scope of claim III.2. 

 

15.4 – True: None of the embodiments of document D1 disclose “biasing 

means associated with said blocking mechanism (5) for urging said blocking 

mechanism into said closed position in a rest position and for allowing its 

passage into the open position under the action of the flow of water admitted 

into the jug through the aperture”. Thus, the subject-matter of such an 

Page 12 of 18


amended claim is novel over D1. Such an amended claim set meets the 

requirement of Article 54 with respect to document D1.  

 

 

Question 16 

 

16.1 – False: Claims IV.1 and IV.2 do not relate to inter-related products in 

the sense of Rule 43(2) (a) EPC as the jug and the filter carrier are presented 

as alternative solutions (Rule 43(2) (c) EPC), they are not disclosed as 

working together or complementing each other (see Guidelines F-IV 3.2(i)).  

 

16.2 – False: Claims IV.1 and IV.2 do not relate to different uses of an 

apparatus, in the sense of Rule 43(2) (b) EPC; rather they relate to alternative 

solutions. The difference lies in the apparatus itself and not in its use.  

 

16.3 – False: To meet the requirements of unity of invention Rule 44(1) EPC 

requires the two inventions to have the same or corresponding special 

technical features. A special technical feature is one that defines a 

contribution that the claimed invention considered as a whole makes over the 

prior art. In this case a filter cartridge is known (see introduction to the 

application) and as such cannot be regarded as a special technical feature. 

Thus, whether or not this feature is in both claims is immaterial when 

determining unity of invention. 

 

16.4 – True: Claims IV.1 and IV.2 have the same characterising feature. This 

feature is not disclosed in D1. As noted previously Rule 44(1) EPC states that 

to meet the requirement of unity of invention the two inventions shall have the 

same special technical feature that defines a contribution that the claimed 

invention considered as a whole makes over the prior art. The common 

special technical feature in this case can be viewed as the characterising 

feature of both claims.  

 

 

 

Page 13 of 18


Question 17 

 

17.1 – True: Providing a blocking mechanism that pivots towards the base of 

the jug when moving from a closed to an open position along with a biasing 

means that allows this movement in response to a flow of water allows the 

blocking mechanism to open automatically in response to a flow of water. This 

effect of the characterising features is supported in paragraph [009] of the 

application.  

 

17.2 – True: Paragraph [009] of the application indicates that biasing means 

that allows the blocking mechanism to pass into the open position under the 

action of the flow of water provides a jug that can be filled without using both 

hands. This solves the problem of providing a jug that is easy to manipulate 

when filling.  

 

17.3 – False: The lid disclosed in document D3 is suitable for use on many 

different jugs including water filters (see paragraph [001] of D3). Thus, the 

statement that D3 is not directed to a lid used with a filtering device is 

incorrect. Furthermore, the advantages provided by D3 of making the jug 

easier to manipulate when filling are also applicable to the jug of D1.  

 

17.4 – False: Claim V.1 does not address the objective technical problem of 

providing a blocking mechanism for a filter lid that only opens in response to a 

flow of water. The blocking mechanism of claim V.1 could, for example, open 

in response to another comparable external downward force on the flap such 

as one provided by a user’s hand. 

 

 

Question 18 

 

18.1 – True: As distinguishing feature 3) detects water in the jug reaching a 

predetermined level (paragraph [014] of the application), the level of water in a 

jug is an indication of an amount of water that is in the jug. 

 

Page 14 of 18


18.2 – False: Distinguishing feature 3) provides an indication of how much 

water there is in the jug rather than explicitly indicating the number of times 

water is added to the jug. Thus, feature 3 does not address the problem of 

how to more accurately determine the number of times water is added to the 

jug. 

 

18.3 – False: Paragraph [014] of the description discloses the possibility of 

false positives arising from the detector of distinguishing feature 3) when for 

example the jug is manipulated to pour water, i.e. not only when water is 

added to the jug. Thus, feature 3) does not address the objective technical 

problem of providing a means that can only generate a signal for incrementing 

a counter in response to water being added to the jug. 

 

 

18.4 – True: None of the cited documents D1 to D3 suggest the provision of a 

water level detector to determine water being added to a jug. Thus, arriving at 

such a detector from a combination of the teachings of these documents is not 

obvious. 

 

 

Question 19 

 

19.1 – False: There is no water level detector in claim VI.1 and thus, the 

presence of a water level detector in D4 is not a valid argument for document 

D4 to be considered the closest prior art to claim VI.1. 

 

19.2 – False: It is not only document D4 that addresses the technical problem 

of improving the accuracy of a filter exhaustion detecting means, document 

D2 also addresses this technical problem (see paragraphs 3 and 4 of D2). 

Thus, it is not a valid argument for considering document D4 to be the closest 

prior art to claim VI.1. 

 

19.3 – False: Document D2 also discloses a blocking mechanism (flexible 

guide 214 and turbine blade 213a, see paragraph 009) which opens by tilting 

Page 15 of 18


towards said jug (see first embodiment where turbine blades turn towards the 

jug under action of water). Furthermore D3 discloses a container lid that is 

used on a jug (see paragraph [001] with a blocking mechanism that opens by 

pivoting towards the jug base (see Figure 3). Thus, D4 is not the only 

document that discloses a jug that has a blocking mechanism that moves into 

an open position by pivoting towards the base and it is not a valid argument 

for considering document D4 to be the closest prior art to claim VI.1. 

 

19.4 – False: The Figure 2 embodiment of document D4 provides a blocking 

mechanism that can be opened with a tap. Thus, the objective technical 

problem of how to provide a jug that allows filling of the jug without the need to 

manually manipulate the lid is not a technical problem in light jug of D4. 

 

 

Question 20 

 

20.1 – False: The objective technical problem is to provide an alternative 

means, for determining the exhaustion of a filter cartridge and document D1 

does disclose an alternative means. Such an alternative means may be less 

accurate but may have other advantages. An alternative does not need to be 

better in all respects to be in certain circumstances selected by the skilled 

person. 

 

20.2 – True: Neither D4 nor the third embodiment of D1 provide a detector 

configured to detect said blocking mechanism moving from said open to said 

closed position. In the third embodiment of D1 there is a counter that is 

manually incremented, while D4 detects a water level within the jug. Therefore 

a combination of D4 and the third embodiment of D1 would not provide a jug 

according to claim VI.1. 

 

20.3 – False: Replacing the lid of D4 with that of D2 would not result in a jug 

according to the subject-matter of claim VI.1 as the lid of D2 has no biasing 

means for biasing the blocking means towards the closed position. Therefore

a combination of D4 and the lid of D2 would not provide a jug according to 

claim VI.1. 

 

20.4 – True: Document D3 discloses a lid for any container that is easy to fill. 

Although it can be used on a filter jug it does not disclose a means of 

determining an exhaustion of a filter and as such a skilled person looking for 

an alternative means for doing this would not look to this document.
