Preliminary remark: the references from the Guidelines are from the version of the 
Guidelines which was to be used in the present examination.  
 
 
Question 1 
 
An inventor resident in a Contracting State is not obliged to be represented by a 
professional representative before the EPO, Article 133(1) and (2) EPC. San Marino is a 
Contracting State since 1 July 2009. In order to be validly represented by a professional 
representative, it is not required to file a signed authorisation: the principle of self-
appointment applies for the first representative (in this case Mr. A). A second 
representative (in this case Mr. B) need not file a signed authorisation, if the European 
Patent Office is notified (by Mr. A) that the previous representative's authorisation has 
terminated, Article 1(1) and (2) of the Decision of the President of the EPO dated 12 July 
2007, Special edition No. 3, OJ EPO 2007, L.1. There is no provision for the payment of 
an administrative fee for the registration of a change of attorney.  
 
1.1 - True 
1.2 - False 
1.3 - True 
1.4 - False 
 
 
 
Question 2 
 
The communication is deemed to be delivered on 25 January 2015 [15 January 2015 + 10 
days, Rule 126(2) EPC]. It is immaterial that the deemed delivery day falls on a Sunday. In 
order to avoid further processing and other prolongation of the proceedings, the reply to 
the communication must be filed at the latest on 26 May 2015 [25 January 2015 + 
4 months (= 25 May 2015), extended to Tuesday 26 May 2015, Rule 131(4) EPC  and 
Rule 134(1) EPC)]. Note that on 25 May 2015 the EPO is closed. Further processing can 
be requested within a period of two months from the communication under Rule112 EPC  
concerning the loss of rights (Article 121(1) EPC and Rule 135(1) EPC). The 
communication is sent only after expiry of the time limit for replying to the communication 
under Article 94(3) EPC: 27 July 2015 is not the latest day for requesting further 
processing. The period for replying to the communication may be extended upon request, 
if the request is presented before the expiry of the period, Rule 132(2) EPC.  
 
2.1 - False   
2.2 - True 
2.3 - False 
2.4 - True

Question 3 
 
The additional search fee is payable within one month from the date of the invitation 
[16 January 2015 + 1 month (=16 February 2015), Rule 40(1)(ii) PCT and Rule 80.2 PCT]. 
There is no “ten day rule” for the delivery of communications under the PCT. Since the 
priority period expires only today, Monday 23 February 2015, you can still file today an 
international application PCT-B claiming priority from PCT-A [21 February 2014 + 12 
months (= Saturday 21 February 2015), extended to 23 February 2013, Article 8(2)(a) PCT 
and Article 4 C (1) of the Stockholm Act of the Paris Convention for the protection of 
industrial property and Rule 80.5 (i) PCT]. The International Searching Authority (in this 
case the EPO) is not competent to carry out a supplementary international search 
(Rule 45bis.9 (b) PCT, see also Guidelines, E-VIII, 1 (vi)). The additional search fee is paid 
directly to the International Searching Authority, Rule 40.2 (b) PCT.  
 
3.1 - False 
3.2 - True 
3.3 - False 
3.4 - True 
 
 
 
Question 4 
 
The notice of opposition must be filed at the latest on 18 March 2015 [18 June 2014 + 
9 months (= 18 March 2015), Article 99(1) EPC and Rule 131(4) EPC]. Mr. Kurz is entitled 
to file the notice of opposition in Czech or in Slovak (Rule 3(1) EPC and 
Article 14(4) EPC). However, according to Rule 6 EPC as entered into force on 
1 April 2014, there is no longer any reduction of the opposition fee. Since the documentary 
evidence was filed in an official language of the EPO, the EPO will not require a 
translation, Rule 3(3) EPC. Any party may use an official language of a Contracting State 
during oral proceedings, but the party must then provide interpretation into the language of 
the proceedings, Rule 4(1) EPC.  
 
4.1 - True 
4.2 - False 
4.3 - True 
4.4 - False 
 
 
 
Question 5 
 
The latest date for entering the European phase is 2 March 2015 [2 August 2012 + 
31 months (= 2 March 2015), Rule 159(1) EPC and Rule 131(4) EPC]. Entry into the 
European phase on 27 March 2015 is possible: however, at least one further processing 
fee is due, Article 121(1) EPC and Rule 135(1) EPC. The applicant is not obliged to file 
amended claims: he may file comments without filing amended claims, Rule 161(1) EPC. 
The renewal fee in respect of the third year for Euro-PCT-M has fallen due earlier, on 31 
August 2014, Article 86(1) EPC and Rule 51(1) EPC. For PCT-M, one of the requirements 
for entry into the European phase on 27 February 2015 is the payment of the renewal fee 
in respect of the third year, Rule 159(1)(g) EPC and Guidelines, A-X, 5.2.4. [Note: For a 
request for early processing to be effective, the applicant must comply with the 

2/10


requirements stipulated in Rule 159(1) EPC as if the 31-month time limit expired on the 
date the applicant requested early processing (see Notice from the European Patent Office 
dated 21 February 2013 concerning the request for early processing, OJ EPO 2013, 156).]    
 
5.1 - False 
5.2 - True 
5.3 - False 
5.4 - True 
 
 
 
Question 6 
 
A European patent application may not be amended in such a way that it contains 
subject-matter which extends beyond the content of the application as filed, 
Article 123(2) EPC. An amendment may be allowable under Article 123(2) EPC although it 
is not based on searched subject-matter (thus offending for instance the requirements of 
Rule 137(5) EPC). If an amendment is novel and inventive over the application as filed, 
then it was not directly and unambiguously derivable from the application as filed. An 
allowable amendment may be based on a drawing, but never on subject-matter found only 
in amendments filed under Article 19 PCT: such amendments are filed after receiving the 
international search report, i.e. well after the filing of the application. 
 
6.1 - False 
6.2 - False 
6.3 - True 
6.4 - False 
 
 
 
Question 7 
 
Priority can be claimed from a utility model, Article 87(1) EPC. Claim 3 is not entitled to 
priority, since this invention was not disclosed in DE-C: the first filing for a solution of the 
substance X in alcohol is EP-C. If the priority for an independent claim is valid, no 
conclusion can be drawn on the validity of the priority of a thereof depending claim.  
 
7.1 - True 
7.2 - True 
7.3 - False 
7.4 - True 
 

3/10


Question 8 
 
Claims 1 and 3 have as their effective date the date of filing of EP-C, Article 87(1) EPC. 
Consequently, the scientific publication is state of the art under Article 54(2) EPC for these 
two claims. Claim 2 is entitled to the priority date of DE-C: the scientific publication is not 
state of the art for claim 2. Claim 3 is novel over the scientific publication, since water and 
alcohol are different solvents.  
 
8.1 - False  
8.2 - True 
8.3 - True 
8.4 - False 
 
 
 
Question 9 
 
The applicant can contest the finding of the search division, e.g. in the response to the 
European search report, Rule 70a(1) EPC. The skilled person has the same level of skill 
for assessing inventive step and sufficient disclosure, (Guidelines, G-VII, 3, last sentence) 
and he may use common general knowledge to carry out the invention. EP-Q can be 
considered for assessing sufficiency of disclosure, only if the document was made 
available to the public no later than on the date of publication of EP-R (Guidelines, F-III, 1, 
5.2 and 8 and H-IV, 2.3.1).  
 
9.1 - True  
9.2 - False 
9.3 - True 
9.4 - True 
 
 
 
Question 10 
 
Any person may give notice of opposition, provided he or she is not the patent proprietor. 
The inventor Ms Smith, the candidate preparing for the EQE and Mr Singer can therefore 
oppose EP-X (Article 99(1) EPC and G 9/93). In the case of Mr Singer filing the opposition 
for Ms Smith, there is no circumvention of the law within the meaning of G 3/97. The 
motivation for filing an opposition is irrelevant. Appeal proceedings are only open to parties 
to proceedings (Article 107 EPC).  
 
10.1 - True 
10.2 - True 
10.3 - False 
10.4 - True

Question 11 
 
The expression „in“ in Claim A) makes it unclear whether protection sought is limited to the 
door leaf per se or whether the whole fire protection door with the door leaf is claimed, see 
also Guidelines, F-IV, 4.15. According to the description, paragraph [0008], the wood 
material of the solid wood plate must be thick enough. The minimum thickness for solid 
oak wood is 8 cm. When using any other type of solid wood, the thickness must be at least 
10 cm, see [0014]. Hence, the thickness  is an essential feature of the invention. Since 
claim A) claims a door leaf in a fire protection door comprising a solid wood plate having a 
smaller thickness as required by the description, claim A) is not supported by the 
description. Claim B) is directed to a door leaf per se, wherein a step of the door leaf is 
defined such that it shall match with a step in a door frame which is however not part of the 
claim. Many different sizes and forms of steps are possible, hence, the size or the form of 
the door leaf step is not defined in claim B) but is dependent from another entity that is not 
part of claim B), see also Guidelines F-IV, 4.14. Hence, claim B) is not clear and does not 
fulfil the requirements of Article 84 EPC. Claim C) is directed to a fire protection door 
comprising a door leaf that comprises a plate made of solid wood. As the claim does not 
specify the thickness, an essential feature for achieving the fire protection property is 
missing, Guidelines F-IV, 4.5. Hence, claim C) contravenes Article 84 EPC.  
 
11.1 - False 
11.2 - False 
11.3 - False 
11.4 - False 
 
 
 
Question 12 
 
A solid wood plate is present in all embodiments of the invention. Also, general statements 
such as in [0006] refer to a solid wood plate to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art as 
referred in [0004]. For a solid wood plate, the description states in paragraphs [0008] and 
[0014] that a minimum thickness of 8 cm or more is essential for the function of the fire 
protection door. Hence feature b) is not an undue limitation of the scope of the claim. A 
watered solid wood plate is mentioned as a preferred embodiment only, see [0009], “we 
preferably use wood that is watered…”. Hence, feature c) is an undue limitation of the 
scope of the independent claim. A covering with metal layers 3, 4 is mentioned in [0016], 
but only with reference to a preferred embodiment. A covering by an aluminium sheet is 
even more specific. Considering the invention and its function as indicated in the 
description, it is not necessary to limit the claim by feature d). A door closer is part of any 
fire protection door, see [0002], and is implicitly mentioned by the term “fire protection 
door”. Since a door closer  is present in any fire protection door, a door leaf for a fire 
protection door must be suitable to be closed by a door closer. Feature e) is not an undue 
limitation of the scope of protection. 
 
12.1 - False 
12.2 - True 
12.3 - True 
12.4 - False

Question 13 
 
D1 discloses in [0003] a door leaf (metal door leaf 100) comprising a plate (calcium silicate 
plate 105) including a material (cardboard containing calcium silicate) containing fibres 
(wood fibres of the cardboard), wherein the material of the plate is such that it delivers 
moisture when heated (see [0003], water of the calcium silicate is released in case of a 
fire). The subject-matter of claim I.4 is not new over D1. Further, D1 discloses a metal 
door, and particularly a steel door, [0002]. However, the specific metal aluminium is not 
disclosed in D1. The subject-matter of claim I.6 is new over D1. D2 discloses (in the first 
paragraph and in the Figure) a door leaf (plate 201 supported by hinges), wherein the door 
leaf comprises a plate (plate 201) including a material containing fibres (plate 201 is made 
of a piece of wood, see first paragraph of D2 and wood generally contains wood fibres, 
see the description of the application, [0009]) wherein the plate (plate 201) is at least 
partially covered by a metal material (see the Figure, and the first paragraph of D2: metal 
bands 203 of the hinges 202 partially cover the plate 201 of the door). The subject-matter 
of claim I.5 is not new over D2. Further, D2 discloses a rock 205 on a cable or a rope 206 
biasing the door to a closed position, and hence a biasing means having a cable and a 
weight. Since D2 discloses the first alternative of claim I.8, the subject-matter of claim I.8 is 
not new over D2.  

13.1 - False 
13.2 - True 
13.3 - False 
13.4 - False 
 
 
 
Question 14 
 
The first embodiment as shown in Fig. 2 and described in [0018] relates to a hinged fire 
protection door, having a door leaf 1a. The second embodiment as shown in Fig. 3 and 
described in [0019] relates to a fire protection door constructed as a sliding door. Both 
embodiments have a door leaf 1, 1a, 1b, respectively. In [0014] to [0016] the general 
construction of a door leaf 1 is described which is applicable to both embodiments. The 
first and second embodiments each have a door closer 12, 23 that biases the door leaf 
into the closed position, [0018]. Hence, the first and the second embodiments of the 
application fall within the scope of claim I.7. In the first embodiment, the door closer 12 has 
a mechanical spring 14 and a lever element 15. This falls under the scope of the second 
alternative of claim I.8. The second embodiment has a door closer 23 including a cable 24 
and a weight 25. This falls under the scope of the first alternative of claim I.8. Hence, both 
the first and the second embodiments fall within the scope of claim I.8. The second 
embodiment relates to a sliding door. The description of the general construction of a door 
leaf in [0017] mentions a door step, but only in connection with a door leaf 1a for a pivoting 
door while a stepped door leaf 1a is not suitable for sliding doors. According to the  

6/10


description, the sliding door of the second embodiment cannot have a stepped door leaf. 
The second embodiment does not fall within the scope of claim I.10.  
 
14.1 - True 
14.2 - True 
14.3 - True 
14.4 - False 
 
 
 
Question 15 
 
D3 discloses a sliding door 500 having a door leaf 501 wherein the door leaf 501 is made 
of a board containing fibres such as cardboard, [0003]. The board containing fibres is a 
plate. As indicated in D1, [0003], cardboard comprises wood fibres. Hence D3 implicitly 
discloses all the features of claim I.1. Further, aluminium layers can be used as the outer 
surfaces, [0004], i.e. both of the major surfaces of the door leaf 501 are covered with 
aluminium layers. The subject-matter of claim I.6 is not novel over D3. The sliding door 
500 of D3 has a door leaf 501 comprising a plate of a material comprising fibres and a 
cable 503 and a weight 504 biasing the door leaf 501 into the fully open state, [0003], i.e. a 
biasing means for biasing the door leaf into a predetermined position. Hence, the first 
alternative of claim I.8 is disclosed in D3 so that the subject-matter of claim I.8 is not novel 
over D3. There is no disclosure in D3 that the sliding door 500 could withstand a fire for a 
predetermined time; further, the door leaf 501 is biased into the fully open state and not 
into the fully closed state as this is necessary for a fire protection door. Hence, there is no 
disclosure in D3 that the sliding door 500 can be a fire protection door. Further, there is no 
disclosure for a stepped edge. The subject-matters of claims I.9 and I.10 are novel over 
D3.  
 
15.1 - True 
15.2 - False 
15.3 - False 
15.4 - True 
 
 
 
Question 16 
 
As indicated in [0009] of the description, solid wood contains mainly wood fibres. Hence, 
the expression “solid wood” already implies a material containing wood fibres. Further, 
[0009] discloses to water solid wood so that the wood fibres contain enough moisture, and 
that the moisture is released in case of fire. Hence, [0009] discloses a solid wood that 
delivers moisture when heated. A combination of all the features of the claims I.1, I.2, I.3, 
and I.4 can be based on the original claims I.1 to I.4 in combination with [0009] of the 
description. As indicated in [0017], a stepped door leaf is only possible in pivoting doors. 
However, a biasing means having a cable and a weight is only disclosed in [0019] and in 
Fig. 3 in conjunction with a sliding door. Because of the first alternative of claim I.8, a 
combination of I.1, I.8, and I.10 would also claim a combination of a biasing means having 
a cable and a weight together with a stepped door leaf. Such combination is not originally 
disclosed. A door leaf 1a having a stepped edge is disclosed in [0017], and [0018] 
discloses a door closer 12 biasing the door leaf 1a into the closed position. Hence, a 
stepped door leaf in combination with a biasing means is disclosed in the description. In 

7/10


the whole description, it is only disclosed to cover a solid wood plate with a metal material. 
There is no disclosure to cover any other fibrous plate having other fibres than wood fibres 
with a metal material. Hence, an amendment of the dependency of claim I.5 to be 
dependent from claim I.1 instead of claim I.2 would contravene Article 123(2) EPC.  
 
16.1 - True 
16.2 - False 
16.3 - True 
16.4 - False 
 
 
 
Question 17 
 
Claim II.1 relates to a door leaf for a fire protection door. From the cited prior art, D1 is the 
only document which clearly relates to a door leaf for a fire protection door and comprises 
a plate containing wood fibres wherein major surfaces of the plate are fully covered by 
metal layers. Hence, D1 relates to door leaves for the same purpose and is the closest 
prior art with regard to claim II.1. D2 is the only document relating to pivoting doors with a 
plate of solid wood and a door closer. D2 is the closest prior art with regard to claim II.5. 
D3 relates to emergency exit doors. D3 discloses in [0003] and in the Figure a sliding door 
501 with a door frame 502 and a biasing means 503, 504, wherein the door leaf 501 is 
made of cardboard, and wherein the major surfaces are covered with an aluminium layer.  
As indicated in D1, [0003], cardboard comprises wood fibres.  The term “especially fire 
protection door” in claim II.4 is not limiting. D3 implicitly discloses the subject matter of 
claim II.4. Although the subject-matter of claim II.4 is not novel over D3 and although 
claim II.7 is dependent from claim II.4, D3 is not the closest prior art with regard to 
claim II.7, because D3 is directed to a door for another purpose, and D1 and D2 are 
directed to fire protection doors so that these documents are closer prior art. Claim II.7 is 
limited to fire protection doors.   
 
17.1 - True 
17.2 - True 
17.3 - True 
17.4 - False 
 
 
Question 18 
 
Solid wood is resistant to bending [0006], hence, one technical effect of the solid wood is 
reducing tendency of the door leaf to bend in the event of fire. A further technical effect of 
the use of a plate made of solid wood is providing heat insulation, see [0007]. While a door 
closer of a fire protection door ensures that the door is always closed in case of fire, 
[0002], this is NOT true for a biasing means biasing the door leaf into any predetermined 
position, see for example D3 and note that claim II.3 does not specify that the door is a fire 
protection door. The aluminium layer protects from drying out, see above, hence, it helps 
to keep the moisture in the wood fibres. This is a combined technical effect. 
 
18.1 - True 
18.2 - True 
18.3 - False 
18.4 - False 

8/10


 
Question 19 
 
In the last sentence of [0003] of D1 it is mentioned that the construction of the fire 
protection door of D1 is complicated because of the necessity to insert a frame structure 
for stiffening. Solid wood has less tendency to bend, a frame structure is not necessary. 
Hence, it is an element of the objective problem solved by the subject-matter of claim II.2 
over D1 to simplify the construction. Providing a plate of solid wood per se does not 
provide a fire protection door simulating the same appearance as an ancient door, 
especially if covered by an aluminium layer. Hence, providing fire protection doors 
simulating the same appearance as ancient doors is not an element of the objective 
technical problem solved by the subject-matter of claim II.2. The state of art for the 
purposes of considering inventive step is defined in Article 54(2) EPC, both documents D1 
and D2 clearly belong to this state of art, and the skilled person is presumed to have had 
access to anything in the “state of art”. Although D2 is a vintage art journal, it describes 
door technology. Further, the skilled person is expected to look for suggestions in 
neighbouring and general technical fields. Hence, the nature of publication of the 
documents D1 and D2 is no valid argument against combining them. D1 discloses a fire 
protection door, and the skilled person learns from D2 that a solid wood door can protect 
from fire. Thus, the skilled person learns from D2 that a solid wood plate is a suitable 
material to be used in door leafs for fire protection doors. This is a valid argument that a 
skilled person would combine D1 and D2.  
 
19.1 - True 
19.2 - False 
19.3 - False 
19.4 - True 
 
 
 
Question 20 
 
D3 discloses a sliding door 500 with a door leaf 501 where the major surfaces thereof can 
be covered with aluminium layers. No technical reason is given for the covering with 
aluminium and it seems that this is only for design purposes. Further D3 relates to 
emergency exit doors and gives no indication at all for a functionality for fire protection. 
Thus, although D3 discloses a door covered by an aluminium layer, there is no teaching in 
D3 that this could improve a fire protection function. D1 discloses a calcium silicate plate 
wherein calcium silicate can release water when heated. The filling of D1 is a cardboard 
containing calcium silicate, no alternatives are given. The statement 20.2 indicates that the 
material of D2 should replace the material of D1. This is not a valid argument within the 
framework of the problem solution approach, since D2 and not D1 is the closest prior art 
document. Hence, the answer to 20.2 is “False”. The formulation of 20.2 was however 
unnecessarily complex. Just by using the expression “D2 could be replaced by” instead of 
“D2 could replace” the solution would become “True”, since there is no teaching that solid 
wood could be replaced by the material of D1. For this reason, it is exceptionally decided 
to award marks for the answer “True” as well. D1 discloses just a door leaf for a fire 
protection door which is formed from two metal sheets that overlap at the side of the door 
leaf. There is no teaching how a door frame could be constructed. Hence, although the 
figure of D1 shows a small step on the side of the door leaf due to a overlap of metal 
sheets, this step is only because two edge portions of the metal sheets overlap; there is no 
teaching to combine a step in a door with a step in a door frame to come to a better sealed 

9/10


door gap. D1 discloses in [0002] that the preferred metal is steel because of its high 
melting point above 1300°C, and it is further mentioned that this has the advantage that 
the metal of the door can withstand normal temperatures occurring during fire and 
maintains its stiffness even at higher temperatures. This leads away from using aluminium 
which melts away in the event of fire. Hence, D1 teaches away from using aluminium in 
fire protection doors.
