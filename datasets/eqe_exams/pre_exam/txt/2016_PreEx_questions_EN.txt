Question 1 

 

Opposition proceedings are pending against all claims of European patent EP-B. The 

only ground of opposition is Article 100(c) EPC. Today, 29 February 2016, the EPO 

receives third party observations against EP-B. The submissions of the third party are as 

follows:  

- 
it is explained that prior art document D1 anticipates claim 1 of EP-B; and 

- 
it is reasoned that the invention in EP-B is not sufficiently disclosed.    

 

For each of the statements 1.1 – 1.4, indicate on the answer sheet whether the 

statement is true or false: 

 

1.1 
Since third party observations can only be filed concerning issues arising under 

Articles 52 to 57 EPC, the opposition division will not consider the reasoning 

concerning lack of sufficiency of disclosure.  

1.2 
The submissions of the third party will be forwarded by the EPO to the patent 

proprietor.  

1.3 
The submissions of the third party will be accessible to the public through file 

inspection.  

1.4 
The opposition division is allowed to introduce into the proceedings lack of 

novelty with respect to claim 1 as a fresh ground for opposition.

If the applicant adds two dependent claims to the set of claims today, the 

examining division will not examine these two claims, unless claims fees are also 

paid.   

2.4 
Third party observations on EP-D filed with the EPO today are no longer 

considered by the examining division, since they are late filed.

Description of the client’s European patent application 

 

[001] The invention relates to a saucepan with an integrated strainer. 

[002] A known saucepan includes a container having an upper opening and a lid with a 

knob wherein, in use, the lid closes the upper opening. After cooking, usually it is 

necessary to separate a solid content from a liquid present in the cooked food. 

Commonly this is accomplished by lifting the lid off the container and pouring the whole 

cooked content of the saucepan into a separate strainer. The solid content is retained in 

the strainer, whereas the liquid is strained away. 

[003] FIG. 1 is an exploded perspective view of a saucepan in accordance with a first 

embodiment of this invention. FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective view of a saucepan in 

accordance with a second embodiment of this invention. Fig 3 is an exploded 

perspective view of a saucepan in accordance with a third embodiment of this invention. 

[004] In the first embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 1 a saucepan includes a 

container 10 and a lid 15. The container 10 has a circular upper opening 70 and a side 

wall 25. The lid 15 has a form such that the circular upper opening 70 of the container 10 

can be closed by the lid 15 during cooking. The lid 15 can be provided with a knob 27. 

The container 10 can further comprise a handle 20.  

[005] The lid 15 comprises a skirt 40 protruding from the rim of the lid. The skirt 40 has 

at least a solid section 50 which has no openings and fits against the inner wall of the 

container 10 when the lid 15 closes the container. The skirt 40 also comprises a 

straining section 45. The straining section 45 provides a plurality of perforations through 

which liquid content of the container can be strained. The perforations are all of the 

same size and are dimensioned such as to only allow liquid to pass through them. 

[006] The saucepan of the first embodiment further comprises a spout 30 located on the 

side wall 25 of the container 10. The spout 30 is a lip protruding from the side wall 25 for 

pouring out the content of the saucepan. 


Claim analysis  

2016/PE/EN 
 
Page 13 of 36 

[007] During cooking, the lid 15 can be rotated within the container 10 to a cooking 

position in which the solid section 50 of the skirt 40 closes the spout 30. The lid 15 in this 

position prevents for example boiling liquid from escaping through the spout 30. 

[008] After cooking, the lid 15 can be rotated within the container 10 to a straining 

position such that the straining section 45 can be placed in communication with the 

spout 30. In the straining position, the lid 15 allows the liquid content of the container 10 

to be strained by tilting the saucepan and holding the lid 15 on the container 10 without 

lifting the lid 15 away from the container 10. 

[009] The saucepan is further equipped with securing means. The securing means 

secure the lid to the container. In this manner the user of the saucepan does not need to 

hold the knob of the lid manually when tilting the container during straining. The securing 

means are engaged whenever the lid is rotated to the straining position. 

[010] In the first embodiment of the invention as shown in FIG. 1 the securing means 

comprise one or more triangular shaped locking tabs 60 protruding outwardly from the 

skirt 40. Locking tabs 60 cooperate with corresponding triangular shaped locking tabs 65 

provided on the inner surface of the side wall 25. The locking tabs 60, 65 are located 

such that when the lid 15 is rotated to the straining position, the locking tabs 60 of the lid 

engage under the corresponding locking tabs 65 of the container 10 to secure the lid 15 

in place. To disengage the locking tabs 60, 65 from each other, the lid 15 is rotated in 

the opposite direction away from the straining position.

2016/PE/EN 
 
Page 14 of 36 

 [011] In the second embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 2, the skirt 40 comprises 

a ring 53 and four protrusions 45, 50 protruding from the ring 53, the protrusions 45, 50 

being separate from each other. One protrusion is the straining section 45 and the other 

protrusions are the solid sections 50, corresponding to the solid sections as described 

for the first embodiment. The open space without wall between the straining section 45 

and the solid sections 50 provides an opening 55 in the skirt 40. 

[012] Located on the side wall 25 of the container is a circular opening 35, instead of the 

spout 30 of FIG. 1. As for the first embodiment, during cooking, the lid 15 can be rotated 

within the container 10 to a cooking position in which a solid section 50 of the skirt 40 

closes the circular opening 35. After cooking, the lid 15 can be rotated within the 

container 10 to a straining position where the straining section 45 is placed in 

communication with the circular opening 35. The lid 15 can also be rotated to a pouring 

position where the opening 55 is placed in communication with the circular opening 35. 

The dimension of the opening 55 is greater than the dimension of the circular 

opening 35. In this pouring position, the content of the container 10 can be poured out 

through the circular opening 35. 

[013] The securing means of the second embodiment of the invention are rectangular 

shaped locking tabs 61, 66, instead of the triangular shaped locking tabs 60, 65 of the 

first embodiment. The rectangular shaped locking tabs 61 of the lid 15 can reversibly 

engage under the corresponding rectangular shaped locking tabs 66 of the inner surface 

of the side wall 25 when the lid 15 is rotated to the straining position.

2016/PE/EN 
 
Page 15 of 36 

[014] In the third embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 3, the skirt 40 of the lid 15 

comprises a straining section 45. The skirt 40 further comprises the opening 55 of 

greater dimension than any of the perforations of the straining section 45. The side 

wall 25 of the container 10 comprises a spout 30. The dimension of the opening 55 is 

greater than the dimension of the spout 30. The lid 15 can be rotated to the pouring 

position where the opening 55 is placed in communication with the spout 30. In this 

pouring position, the content of the container 10 can be poured out through the spout 30. 

[015] FIG. 3 further shows the securing means of the third embodiment. The securing 

means comprise a plurality of pegs 58 located on the inner surface of side wall 25 and a 

plurality of corresponding L-shaped slots 59 located on the skirt 40. Pegs 58 and 

slots 59 are positioned in correspondence to each other such that when the user rotates 

lid 15 into the straining position, pegs 58 engage the horizontal portions of slots 59, 

thereby securing the lid 15 to container 10. These are securing means of the bayonet 

type. 

[016] The upper surface of the lid 15 of any of the embodiments may comprise an 

engraved arrow (not shown). When the arrow points towards the handle 20 of the 

container 10, the lid 15 is placed in the straining position. In this manner the user can 

bring the lid 15 to the straining position without looking through the spout 30 or the 

circular opening 35 to identify the position of the straining section. 

[017] The saucepan in accordance with the invention is very simple to use. The lid 15 

can be rotated in the cooking position and in the straining position while keeping the 

lid 15 on the container 10. When the pieces of cooked food are bigger than the 

dimension of the opening 55 of the skirt 40, the lid 15 can be lifted off the container 10 to 

pour out the contents from the circular upper opening 70.

Document D1 

 

[001] A kitchen utensil for washing vegetables is shown in FIG. 1. This kitchen utensil 

comprises a container 1 and a lid 2. Both the container 1 and the lid 2 are made of a 

light and soft plastic material. 

[002] The lid 2 can be placed on the upper circular opening of the container 1 to close it. 

The lid 2 is provided with a dome-shaped top portion 20 with a central knob 21. The top 

portion 20 is provided with a plurality of perforations 25 all having the same size. The 

diameter of the perforations 25 is smaller than the size of the vegetables which are 

washed with cold or at maximum lukewarm water, and which must subsequently be 

strained.   

[003] Releasable securing means are further provided for the securing of the lid 2 onto 

the container 1. Such releasable securing means can be of the bayonet type whereby 

the inner wall of the container 1 has at least two pegs 12 and the lid 2 has at least two 

corresponding L-shaped slots 27.  

[004] In order to secure the lid 2 onto the container 1 it is necessary first to insert the 

pegs 12 into the open ends of the L-shaped slots 27 and then to rotate the lid 2 with 

respect to the container 1 until each peg 12 engages the horizontal portion of the 

respective L-shaped slot 27.  

[005] During straining, the water flows out through the perforations 25 with the lid 2 

being secured to the container 1. The vegetables do not pass through the 

perforations 25 and are held by the lid 2. The vegetables are then poured out through 

the circular upper opening of the container 1 after the lid 2 has been lifted off.

Document D2 

 

[001] As shown in FIG. 1, a saucepan 1 includes a container 2 and a lid 3. The 

container 2 has a rim 7 defining an upper opening 8 which the lid 3 can close. The 

container 2 has a handle 9 attached to a side wall. The lid 3 has a knob 15 and a skirt 4. 

[002] As shown in FIG. 2, the skirt 4 provides straining zones through which liquid 

contents can be strained out of the container. The straining zones comprise a plurality of 

perforations 19. Preferably, a first straining zone is provided with perforations of one size 

and a second straining zone is provided with perforations of a larger size (not shown). 

The larger perforations can be dimensioned such as to allow to pour out solid contents. 

[003] The lid 3 and the skirt 4 are shaped and sized so that when the lid 3 completely 

closes the container 2, the skirt 4 is located within the container 2 whereby a clearance 

between the skirt 4 and the inner surface of the side wall 6 of the container 2 is present. 

In this way, the lid 3 together with the skirt 4 can be lifted straight out of the container 2.  

[004] The skirt 4 is used to strain liquid contents from within the container 2. This is 

shown in FIG. 3 in a cross section. When a finger of a user presses on a part of the rim 

of the lid 3, the lid 3 can be pivoted by an angle alpha (α) from the container 2. The 

shape and size of the skirt 4 is such that the bottom part 42 of the skirt 4, when the lid 3 

is pivoted by the angle alpha (α), engages with the inner surface of the side wall 6 and 

blocks in this position. As a result, the lid 3 and the bottom part 42 of the skirt 4 are held 

in this position thereby partially opening the container 2. The liquid content can exit 

through the perforations 19 whilst the engagement of the bottom part 42 of the skirt 4 

with the inner side wall 6 prevents solid contents from escaping out of the container 2.

FIG. 1

Document D3 

 

[001] FIG. 1 shows a saucepan in cross section comprising a container 5 having a 

spout 7 and a lid 9 comprising a knob 12 and a skirt 10 having openings 11.  

[002] The skirt 10 with the openings 11 provides an annular straining portion of the lid 9. 

The straining portion is in communication with the spout 7 in any seated position of the 

lid 9 on the container 5. 

[003] When the user carefully tilts the container 5 while holding the lid 9 in place with a 

free hand, only the liquid content passes through the openings 11 and can be poured 

out of the container, whilst solid content, such as cooked vegetables, is retained within 

the container 5.

Document D4 

 

[001] FIG. 1 shows a saucepan in a cross section comprising a container 1 and a lid 4.  

The lid 4 can be locked to the container 1 by one or more bayonet joints. Each bayonet 

joint comprises an L-shaped slot 6 in a cylindrical skirt of the lid 4 and a peg 62 on the 

inner surface of the side wall of the container 1. The peg 62 engages into the slot 6 as 

shown in FIG. 1. 

[002] The lid 4 further comprises an opening 2, as shown in the exploded perspective 

view of FIG. 2. This opening 2 is large enough to permit the vapour to escape from the 

saucepan when the pressure inside the saucepan exceeds a threshold pressure. The 

opening 2 is closed by means of a cap 5. The weight of the cap 5 corresponds to the 

force exerted on it by the vapour at the threshold pressure. The saucepan therefore 

functions as a pressure cooker.
