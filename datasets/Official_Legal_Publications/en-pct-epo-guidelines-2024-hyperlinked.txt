PCT-EPO Guidelines
General Part – 1

1.
Preliminary remarks

The present Guidelines are dedicated to the specific procedures before the 
EPO in its capacity as PCT Authority. Their full name is "Guidelines for 
Search and Examination at the European Patent Office as PCT Authority", 
or "PCT-EPO Guidelines" for short, and throughout these Guidelines they 
are also referred to as "GL/PCT-EPO".

These Guidelines can be used and referred to by examiners and formalities 
officers, as well as patent attorneys, in addition to the Euro-PCT Guide 
("PCT procedure at the EPO, [International phase and entry into the 
European phase], Guide for applicants"), the PCT-RO (Receiving Office) 
Guidelines and the PCT ISPE (International Search and Preliminary 
Examination) Guidelines. They are complementary to, but not a substitute 
for, the ISPE and RO Guidelines, as well as the PCT Applicant's Guide 
("WIPO PCT Guide"), all published by WIPO. They will exist in parallel with 
the Euro-PCT Guide which, as before, has the status of a Notice from the 
EPO.

The PCT-EPO Guidelines are published as a standalone document in 
electronic format only, and will be revised on a yearly basis at the same 
time as the Guidelines for Examination in the European Patent Office ("EP 
Guidelines"). The electronic publication includes not only the online version 
in HTML format, but also a printable file. 

The aim is to gradually expand the PCT-EPO Guidelines with each revision 
cycle. The major change in this ninth edition is the further development of 
Part A, which now includes new sections on the form and signature of 
documents.

Any indication from readers drawing attention to errors as well as 
suggestions for improvement is highly appreciated and may be sent by 
email to Department 5.3.1.1, Patent Filing Process and PCT Affairs, at 
international_pct_affairs@epo.org.

2.
Explanatory notes

2.1
Overview

The PCT-EPO Guidelines follow the structure of the EP Guidelines (Parts 
A, B, C, E, F, G and H, without D because there is no opposition, limitation 
or revocation under the PCT), and as far as possible the organisation within 
each part is similar to that of the EP Guidelines, adapted to the 
particularities of the PCT system. The sequence of chapters within Part A, 
however, differs from that of the EP Guidelines. This is due to the particular 
way in which the content is being gradually extended and the structure may 
be reconsidered prior to completion of Part A.


General Part – 2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

Thus, these Guidelines comprise the following seven parts:

Part A:
Guidelines for Formalities Examination;

Part B:
Guidelines for Search;

Part C:
Guidelines for Procedural Aspects in Chapter II;

Part E:
Guidelines on General Procedural Matters;

Part F:
The International Application

Part G:
Patentability

Part H:
Amendments and Corrections

Part A deals with the procedures for formalities examination at the EPO in 
its capacity as RO, (S)ISA and IPEA. Part B deals with search matters. 
Part C relates to procedures to be followed in Chapter II.

Part E deals with procedural matters relevant to several or all of the stages 
in procedure at the EPO as PCT Authority. Part F deals with the 
requirements which the application must fulfil other than patentability, in 
particular unity of invention (Rule 13), sufficiency of disclosure (Art. 5), 
clarity (Art. 6) and the right to priority (Art. 8). Part G deals with excluded 
subject-matter (Art. 17(2)(a)(i) and Rule 39; Art. 34(4)(a)(i) and Rule 67), 
novelty (Art. 33(2)), inventive step (Art. 33(3)) and industrial application 
(Art. 33(4)). Part H deals with the requirements relating to amendments and 
corrections. It relates in particular to the right to amend, the allowability of 
amendments and the correction of defects and errors. 

Each part of the Guidelines is divided into chapters, each subdivided into 
numbered sections which may be further divided into subsections. 
Cross-references to other sections and subsections are in the format 
GL/PCT-EPO, followed by the relevant letter of that part, then the chapter 
number (a Roman numeral) and then the section or subsection number 
(thus, e.g. GL/PCT-EPO C-V, 4.2 would be used to refer to subsection 4.2 
of chapter V of Part C of the PCT-EPO Guidelines). When referring to the 
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO, the same format is used, but with 
"GL/EPO" instead of "GL/PCT-EPO".

Marginal references to articles and rules without further identification relate 
to the Articles or Rules of the Patent Cooperation Treaty which provide 
authority for what is stated. It is believed that such references avoid the 
need for extensive quotation from the PCT itself. References to Articles or 
Rules of the European Patent Convention are followed by "EPC".

Marginal references to the RO and ISPE Guidelines relate to the 
corresponding sections in those Guidelines and are an indication that the 
present Guidelines apply within the framework of the RO and ISPE 
Guidelines, in conformity with the supplementary role of the EPC in the 
international phase.

Art. 150(2) EPC


March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
General Part – 3

Where the practice for EP and PCT applications is the same (e.g. for the 
assessment of novelty), cross-references are made to the EP Guidelines. 
Where the practices are only partially overlapping, the information is 
contained in full in the PCT-EPO Guidelines, in order to avoid possible 
confusion. Chapter 3, Annex I, provides an EPC-PCT concordance table.

Any references to persons made in the PCT-EPO Guidelines are to be 
understood as being gender-neutral.

2.2
Applicability of the PCT-EPO Guidelines

These Guidelines are intended to cover normal occurrences. They should 
therefore be considered only as general instructions. The application of 
these Guidelines to individual international patent applications is the 
responsibility of the formalities and examining staff and they may have to 
go beyond these instructions in exceptional cases. Nevertheless, as a 
general rule, parties can expect the EPO in its capacity as RO, (S)ISA or 
IPEA to act in accordance with these Guidelines until such time as they – or 
the relevant legal provisions – are amended. Notices concerning such 
amendments are published in the Official Journal of the EPO and on the 
EPO website. It should also be noted that these Guidelines do not 
constitute legal provisions.

2.3
Relationship between the PCT-EPO Guidelines and the ISPE 

Guidelines
The PCT-EPO Guidelines are intended to be complementary to, but not a 
substitute for, the PCT ISPE1 and RO Guidelines, as well as the PCT 
Applicant's Guide ("WIPO PCT Guide") and the Euro-PCT Guide2 ("PCT 
procedure at the EPO, [International phase and entry into the European 
phase], Guide for applicants").

The ISPE Guidelines published by WIPO set out in detail the procedures 
and criteria to be followed by all International Searching and Preliminary 
Examining Authorities. Since practice varies amongst different authorities 
these Guidelines provide some degrees of freedom as to which 
procedure/criteria can be used. Such different criteria are listed in the ISPE 
Guidelines in appendices to the respective chapters or defined within a 
specific paragraph. Generally, the EPO will use the same criteria when 
searching and examining an international application as would have been 
used in the European procedure. This means that where the ISPE 
Guidelines are either silent or give no guidance on a particular topic, then 
the equivalent provisions of the EP Guidelines are applied mutatis mutandis
to PCT search and preliminary examination. A list of policy options is 
provided in section 3.2 below, Annex II.

2.4

PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part A – Chapter I-1

Chapter I – Introduction

1.
Overview

This current edition of Part A of the PCT-EPO Guidelines deals with filing 
requirements (Chapter A-II), fees (Chapter A-III), certain special provisions 
(Chapter A-IV), drawings (Chapter A-V),
certain formal requirements 

(Chapter A-VI), languages (Chapter A-VII) and common provisions 
(Chapter A-VIII). Other chapters relating to formalities will gradually be 
added in successive editions.

2.
Purpose of Part A

Formalities officers should note that this Part A is intended to provide them 
with knowledge and background to help them carry out their functions in a 
uniform and expeditious manner. It provides guidance in addition to other 
relevant PCT legal sources, such as the PCT Administrative Instructions, 
the PCT Receiving Office Guidelines, the PCT International Search and 
Preliminary Examination Guidelines and the Euro-PCT Guide. In case of 
conflict, the PCT Administrative Instructions, the PCT Receiving Office 
Guidelines and the PCT International Search and Preliminary Examination 
Guidelines prevail.

3.
Other Parts relating to formalities

It should be noted that information on the procedures for formalities 
examination at the EPO in its capacity as RO, (S)ISA and IPEA is not 
restricted to this Part A. Other chapters of the PCT-EPO Guidelines are
necessary for the work carried out by formalities officers.



March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part A – Chapter II-1

Chapter II – Filing of international applications 
and examination on filing

1.
Where and how international applications may be filed

1.1
Filing with the EPO as receiving Office

Natural and legal persons who are nationals or residents of a PCT 
contracting state may file an international application with any of the 
following as receiving Office, provided that this option is available to them:

–
the national office of that state

–
the office acting for that state

–
the International Bureau (IB)

Natural and legal persons who are nationals or residents of an EPC 
contracting state may file an international application with the EPO as 
receiving Office instead.

The national patent offices of Belgium, Monaco, Montenegro and San 
Marino have ceased to act as receiving Offices under the PCT and 
delegated this task to the EPO, which will thus act as receiving Office on 
their behalf for all international applications filed by applicants who are 
nationals or residents of, or have their principal place of business in, one of 
these states.

For more information on when the EPO is competent to act as receiving 
Office, see GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 2.

1.2
Methods of filing with the EPO as receiving Office

International applications must be filed using the PCT request form 
(PCT/RO/101) and submitted either electronically or on paper.

1.2.1
Filing of applications electronically

An international application may be filed electronically with the EPO as 
receiving Office.

The EPO offers the following free-of-charge electronic filing tools:

–
Online Filing (OLF), a software application

–
Online Filing 2.0

–
Web-Form Filing

–
EPO Contingency Upload Service

In addition, applicants may use ePCT, an electronic filing tool offered by 
WIPO.

Part A – Chapter II-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

The EPO no longer accepts international applications filed with it as 
receiving Office using the PCT-SAFE filing software. This has been the 
case since 1 July 2020.

Filings using the OLF software may be made online or on electronic data 
carriers accepted by the EPO. At present, the data carriers accepted are 
CD-Rs conforming to ISO 9660, DVD-Rs and DVD+Rs.

All the means of electronic filing, except for the Web-Form Filing service
and the EPO Contingency Upload Service, allow applicants to fill in the 
PCT request form (PCT/RO/101) directly in the electronic document 
formats that are accepted by the EPO as receiving Office.

If the documents making up the international application have been 
prepared by conversion from a different electronic document format (pre-
conversion format), the applicant may submit the documents in that format 
too, preferably together with a statement that the international application in 
electronic form is a complete and accurate copy of the documents in pre-
conversion format. Each pre-conversion document must be in a format that 
fulfils the requirements stipulated in OJ EPO 2023, A48. It is recommended 
that pre-conversion documents be submitted as ZIP files.

1.2.2
Filing of applications by fax

An international application may be filed by fax with one of the EPO's filing 
offices in Munich, The Hague or Berlin. All EPO filing offices are based in 
the Central European Time (CET) zone.

If an international application is filed by fax, the date on which the 
application documents are received in full is accorded as the date of filing, 
provided 
that 
the 
requirements 
under 
Art. 11
are 
fulfilled 
(see 

GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 4.1).

If an international application is filed by fax, the original, i.e. the 
confirmation copy, must be filed, preferably simultaneously, and the fax 
should state that the confirmation copy has been filed separately on paper 
at the same time. The confirmation copy should be a single copy of each 
document making up the application and each accompanying document. 
The first page of the PCT request form (PCT/RO/101) sent as a 
confirmation copy should be marked "CONFIRMATION COPY", followed by 
the date of the fax transmission. It is recommended that the confirmation 
copy be accompanied by EPO Form 1032, which is available on the EPO 
website.

If the confirmation copy has not been received within 14 days of receipt of 
the application, the EPO as receiving Office will despatch an invitation to 
submit it within a month (Form PCT/RO/141). If the confirmation copy is not 
provided within this time limit, the international application will be 
considered withdrawn (Form PCT/RO/117).

If an international application filed by fax is illegible or incomplete, or the fax 
transmission has failed, the application will be treated as not having been

received and the sender must be notified as soon as possible using 
Form PCT/RO/140.

1.2.3
Filing of applications by delivery by hand or by post

An international application may be filed by delivery by hand or by post with 
one of the EPO's filing offices in Munich, The Hague or Berlin. All EPO filing 
offices are based in the Central European Time (CET) zone. For further 
details, see GL/EPO A-II, 1.2. The documents making up the international 
application must be filed in one copy only.

The date of filing accorded to an application delivered by hand or by post is 
the date of handing over or receipt respectively at an EPO filing office, 
provided 
that 
the 
requirements 
under 
Art. 11
are 
fulfilled 

(see GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 4.1).

If a filing sent by post is lost or delayed, the EPO accepts evidence of 
posting only if the document was sent via a postal authority or one of the 
following generally recognised postal service providers: Chronopost, DHL, 
Federal Express, flexpress, TNT, SkyNet, UPS or Transworld. As evidence, 
confirmation of registration by the post office or confirmation of receipt by 
the postal service provider must be provided at the EPO's request. 
Rules 82 and 82quater do not apply to the priority period, but they do apply 
to the time limit for submission of a request for restoration of the right of 
priority under Rule 26bis.3 (see GL/PCT-EPO A-VI, 1.5).

1.2.4
Filing of applications by other means

International applications may not be filed with the EPO by email or similar 
means of communication. Any application filed by such means will be 
considered not to have been received and the applicant will be informed 
accordingly using Form PCT/RO/142.

1.3
Filing of documents subsequent to the application

Documents subsequent to the international application may be filed with the 
EPO 
as 
receiving 
Office 
electronically
or 
on 
paper; 
see 

GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 1.2.

In the international phase, authorisations may not be filed with the EPO as 
receiving Office by fax or using the EPO Web-Form Filing service.

Priority documents may not be filed by fax, using the EPO Web-Form Filing 
service or using the EPO Contingency Upload Service. Priority documents 
may be filed electronically using OLF or Online Filing 2.0, provided they 
have been digitally signed by the issuing authority and the signature is 
accepted by the EPO. Priority documents may also be filed with the IB 
using ePCT.

If a document subsequent to the international application is filed by fax, 
there is no need to submit a confirmation copy unless the receiving Office 
invites the applicant to submit one (Form PCT/RO/141). It might do so 
particularly for substitute sheets under Rule 26
and sheets to be 

incorporated by reference under Rule 20.6. For such sheets, applicants are 
therefore advised to submit a confirmation copy on their own initiative

directly after sending them by fax. If a confirmation copy is not submitted 
within the time limit prescribed in the invitation issued by the receiving 
Office, the document will be treated as not having been received 
(Form PCT/RO/149).

1.4
Debit orders for deposit accounts held with the EPO

An international application may be accompanied by a debit order for the 
fees due on filing. For the electronic means of filing accepted for debit 
orders, see GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 3.

1.5
Application numbering system

At the EPO, the number range starting at 000001 (PCT/EPyyyy/000001) is 
used for paper filings (including faxes). The number range starting at 
025000 (PCT/EPyyyy/025000) is used for filings made via Web-Form 
Filing. The number range starting at 050000 (PCT/EPyyyy/050000) is 
assigned to electronic filings made using Online Filing 2.0, OLF or ePCT.

2.
Competence of the EPO to act as receiving Office

The EPO is competent to act as the receiving Office for an international 
application provided that:

–
The applicant is a national or resident of an EPC contracting state 
which is also a PCT contracting state (currently the case for all EPC 
contracting states). If there are two or more applicants, at least one 
must be a resident or national of an EPC contracting state. A person 
mentioned only as an inventor does not qualify as an applicant. 
Hence, the nationality or residence of a person mentioned only as an 
inventor is irrelevant for determining whether the EPO is competent 
to act as receiving Office.

–
The international application is filed in one of the EPO's official 
languages (English, French or German).

Where the applicant is not a national or resident of an EPC contracting 
state or the application is in a language other than English, French or 
German, the EPO is not the competent receiving Office and the EPO will 
transmit the purported international application to the IB. The applicant will 
be informed accordingly (Form PCT/RO/151). For the purpose of the 
international filing date, the application will nevertheless be considered to 
have been received by the IB as receiving Office on the date that the EPO 
received it. In such cases, the EPO does not charge the transmittal fee for 
the transmittal of the documents to the IB. Any fees paid to the EPO will be 
refunded.

3.
Procedure on filing

3.1
Acknowledgement of receipt

For international applications filed online using OLF, Online Filing 2.0 or 
Web-Form Filing, receipt is acknowledged electronically following 
successful submission. The acknowledgement contains the identity of the 
receiving Office, the date and time of receipt, a reference or application

number, a list of the files transmitted and, for online filings using OLF or
Online Filing 2.0, a message digest, i.e. the message in compressed form.

The EPO as receiving Office will acknowledge receipt of a purported 
international application filed on paper, by fax or using an electronic data 
carrier using EPO Form 1031, which will be sent by post, as a rule within 
four working days. In it, the EPO will explicitly confirm the receipt of each 
document making up the international application and each accompanying 
item. However, the EPO does not verify the number of sheets making up a 
given document. EPO Form 1031 is also sent for international applications 
filed using Web-Form Filing, in addition to the electronic acknowledgement 
of receipt generated for such applications.

The EPO acknowledges receipt of documents filed using the EPO 
Contingency 
Upload 
Service 
electronically 
in 
the 
service. 
An 

acknowledgement indicating in particular the application number, where 
applicable, is also sent in accordance with the provisions governing the 
filing of documents on paper.

Upon receipt of paper documents purporting to be an international 
application, the EPO as receiving Office proceeds according to 
GL/RO, Chapter IV, paragraph 35.

For general information on the receipt of documents at the EPO and for 
information on acknowledgement of receipt by fax, see GL/EPO A-II, 3.1, 
which applies mutatis mutandis to international applications.

3.2
Filing via a competent national authority

The national law of an EPC contracting state may stipulate that, for national 
security reasons, an international application must be filed with the EPO as 
receiving Office via a competent authority of that state.

In such cases, the national authority will act as the "filing office" for the EPO 
acting as receiving Office. The date of receipt of the application by the 
national authority will be accorded as the international filing date by the 
EPO as receiving Office, provided that the application meets the PCT 
requirements for a filing date to be accorded (see GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 4.1).

The national authority must ensure that the application reaches the EPO 
not later than two weeks before the end of the 13th month from filing or, if 
priority is claimed, from the earliest date of priority. For further details, see 
GL/RO Chapter III.

4.
Examination on filing

4.1
Minimum requirements for according an international filing date

The international filing date of an international application is the date on 
which it is received at one of the EPO's filing offices, or at a national 
authority in an EPC contracting state (see GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 3.2), provided 
that the following minimum requirements are fulfilled at the time of receipt:

–
The applicant is a resident or national of an EPC contracting state.

–
The application (description and claim(s)) is in English, French or 
German.

–
The application contains at least the following elements:

–
an indication that it is intended as an international application 
(this indication is in the header of the request form, 
PCT/RO/101)

–
a request which constitutes the designation of a state bound 
by the PCT on the international filing date (filing the request 
form, 
PCT/RO/101, 
automatically 
designates 
all 
PCT 

contracting states)

–
the name of the applicant

–
a part which on the face of it appears to be a description

–
a part which on the face of it appears to be a claim or claims.

If these requirements have been fulfilled, the purported international 
application will be accorded its actual date of receipt as the international 
filing date; the applicant will be notified accordingly (Form PCT/RO/105).

4.2
Defects

If the EPO as receiving Office finds that, at the time of receipt, the 
international application does not comply with one or more of the 
requirements under Art. 11 for according an international filing date, it will 
invite the applicant to file the required correction(s) within two months of the 
date of the invitation (Form PCT/RO/103). If the applicant complies, the 
international filing date will be the date of receipt of the correction(s); 
otherwise, the application will not be treated as an international application 
(Form PCT/RO/104). For further details on the procedure followed by the 
EPO as receiving Office in the event of defects under Art. 11(1), see 
GL/RO 45-48 and 50.

If the defect is the omission of an element (description or claims), the 
applicant may decide either to furnish the missing element as a correction 
under Art. 11(2) and R. 20.3(a)(i) as described above or to confirm its 
incorporation 
by 
reference. 
The second option 
is 
described in 

GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 5.

If the time limit for the correction of the purported international application 
expires after the 12-month priority period, the applicant's attention is drawn 
to this circumstance in Form PCT/RO/103.

5.
Incorporation by reference of missing elements or parts

If the applicant has omitted to file with the international application a part of 
the description or of the claims, part or all of the drawings or an entire 
element, i.e. the entire description or all the claims, the omission may be 
incorporated in the international application by reference.

Art. 11(2)
R. 20
GL/RO 45-48A

R. 4.18, 20.3, 20.5, 
20.6, 20.7


March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part A – Chapter II-7

Firstly, the omission must be completely contained in an application from 
which priority was claimed on the international filing date. For an omission 
to be "completely contained", it must be identical to the corresponding 
text/drawing in the priority document.

Secondly, the PCT request must have contained a statement of 
incorporation by reference to the priority application. A statement to that 
effect is already provided for in Box VI of the PCT request form 
(PCT/RO/101).

Thirdly, the conditions for confirmation in Rules 20.6 and 20.7 must be met.

If all the conditions are met, the omission is considered to be incorporated 
by reference and the international filing date is unaffected.

If the description and/or claims as contained in the priority application do 
not qualify as missing parts on the grounds that the international application 
already contained a complete description and/or a complete set of claims, 
the EPO as receiving Office will proceed to a negative finding under GL/RO 
paragraph 205D and will not transmit the international application to the IB 
in accordance with Rule 19.4(a)(iii).

An applicant wishing to add to an international application omitted parts 
which have no basis in a priority application may do so under Rule 20.5. 
However, the filing date of the application as a whole will then be the date 
on which the missing parts are filed.

6.
Correction of erroneously filed elements or parts

If the international application contains an erroneously filed element 
(description or claims) or an erroneously filed part of the description, claims 
or drawings (including the case where all the drawings have been 
erroneously filed), the applicant may correct the international application by 
furnishing the correct element or part under Rule 20.5bis.

According to that rule, which entered into force on 1 July 2020, the 
applicant may request to either

(a)
correct the international application under Rule 20.5bis(b) or (c) (see 
GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 6.1); or

(b)
where the correct element or part is contained in a priority 
application, incorporate it in the international application by reference 
under Rule 20.5bis(d).

Until 31 October 2022, this latter option was not available at the EPO, since 
this procedure was incompatible with the legal framework under the EPC. 
The EPO as receiving Office had therefore notified the IB of this 
incompatibility under Rule 20.8(a-bis). However, following the withdrawal of
this notification of incompatibility with Rule 20.5bis(a)(ii) and (d), the EPO 
as receiving Office may now also process requests for incorporation by 
reference of the correct element or part for international applications filed 
on or after 1 November 2022. See GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 6.2.

For details on the procedure before the EPO as International Searching 
Authority, see GL/PCT-EPO B-III, 2.3.3. For the procedure before the EPO 
as designated or elected Office, see GL/EPO C-III, 1.3.

6.1
Correct element or part not furnished for the purpose of 

incorporation by reference
The procedure to be followed varies depending on whether the correction is 
requested either on/before the date on which the requirements under 
Art. 11(1) for the accordance of an international filing date are fulfilled (see 
GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 6.1.1) or after that date (see GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 6.1.2).

6.1.1
International filing date has not yet been accorded

If the international filing date has not yet been accorded, the wrong element 
or part will be replaced with the correct one and the international filing date 
will be the date on which the requirements under Art. 11(1) are fulfilled, 
taking into account the correct element or part only. The EPO as receiving 
Office follows the procedure outlined in AI, section 310.

6.1.2
International filing date has already been accorded

If the requirements under Art. 11(1) have already been fulfilled and the 
international filing date has been accorded, the wrong element or part will 
be replaced with the correct one and the international filing date will be 
changed to the date on which the correct element or part was received, 
unless the applicant requests that the correct element or part be 
disregarded under Rule 20.5bis(e). The EPO as receiving Office follows the 
procedure outlined in AI, sections 310 and 310bis.

6.2
Correct element or part furnished for the purpose of 

incorporation by reference
For international applications filed on or after 1 November 2022, the EPO 
as receiving Office will process requests for incorporation by reference 
under Rule 20.5bis(d) of the correct element or part. If the requirements of 
Rules 20.6(b) and 4.18 are fulfilled, the correct element or part will be 
considered to have been contained in the purported international 
application on the date on which one or more elements referred to 
in Art. 11(1)(iii) were first received by the receiving Office, without a change 
to the international filing date. The wrong element or part, marked as 
"ERRONEOUSLY FILED (RULE 20.5bis)", will remain in the international 
application. The EPO as receiving Office follows the procedure outlined in 
AI, section 309.

For the procedure before the EPO as ISA see GL/PCT-EPO B-III, 2.3.3 and 
for the procedure before the EPO as SISA see GL/PCT-EPO B-XII, 3. For 
the procedure before the EPO as IPEA see GL/PCT-EPO H-II, 2.2.2 and

PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part A – Chapter II-9

For international applications filed until 31 October 2022, if the applicant 
requests within the time limit under Rule 20.7 that a correct element or part 
be incorporated by reference, the EPO as receiving Office will transmit the 
international application to the IB as receiving Office, provided the applicant 
authorises it to do so. No fee will be charged under Rule 19.4(b) for such 
transmittal. Unless the applicant has already submitted authorisation to 
transmit the international application, the EPO as receiving Office will invite 
the applicant to do so using Form PCT/RO/152.

If the applicant does not authorise the transmittal, the request will be 
treated as a request for correction under Rule 20.5bis(b) or (c). The EPO 
as receiving Office will therefore follow the procedure outlined in 
GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 6.1.

Chapter III – Fees

1.
General

Guidance for the payment of fees, expenses and prices is published in 
each issue of the EPO's Official Journal. Updated information relating to 
fees and methods of payment, including the EPO bank account for 
payments in euro, can also be found on the EPO website (epo.org) under: 
Applying for a patent → Fees → International (PCT) fees. Applicants are 
also recommended to consult the latest information available on the WIPO 
website.

2.
Amounts of fees

The latest information about amounts can be found on both the EPO 
website (epo.org, under Applying for a patent → Fees → International 
(PCT) fees → Fees for international applications) and the WIPO website 
(wipo.int, under IP Services → PCT – The International Patent System → 
PCT Fee Tables).

In addition, the amounts of the fees to be paid to the EPO can be found in 
the EPO's Schedule of fees and expenses published in the Official Journal 
and accessible via the EPO website (epo.org, under Law & practice → 
Legal texts → Official Journal).

The amount of fees to be paid for the benefit of the IB is fixed in Swiss 
francs and is specified in the Schedule of Fees which is annexed to the 
PCT Regulations (PCT Schedule of Fees) and forms an integral part 
thereof. If these fees are paid to the EPO, they must be paid in euros. Due 
to changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the Swiss franc, the 
equivalent amount is changed from time to time. Current fee rates are 
published in the PCT Newsletter, in WIPO's Official Notices (PCT Gazette) 
and in the EPO's Official Journal.

3.
Methods of payment

Fee payments to the EPO may be validly made by anyone: applicants, 
agents and any other person.

All fees which are to be paid to the EPO must be paid in euros:

–
by payment or transfer to a bank account held by the EPO; or

–
by credit card; or

–
by debiting a deposit account held with the EPO on the basis of a 
debit order filed in an electronically processable format (XML) using 
one of the accepted electronic means of filing, i.e. the EPO Online 
Filing software, Online Filing 2.0 or ePCT. Alternatively, a debit order 
can be submitted in electronic format via Central Fee Payment. 
Details of payment by deposit account may be found in the 
Arrangements for deposit accounts (ADA) and their annexes, which 
can also be found on the EPO website (epo.org).

PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

In the event of a general unavailability of the permitted electronic means of 
communication, the EPO will make use of the extension of time limits for 
the payment of fees, as for the performance of any other procedural acts, 
and will inform the IB accordingly.

Payment of fees by cheque delivered or sent directly to the EPO was 
abolished with effect from 1 April 2008.

The date to be considered as the date on which a payment is made is 
established in accordance with the EPO's Rules relating to Fees.

4.
Fees to be paid to the EPO as receiving Office

4.1
Transmittal fee

The transmittal fee is paid for the benefit of the EPO as receiving Office 
(RO/EP) and its amount is fixed by the EPO. It is to be paid within one 
month from the date of receipt of the international application. The amount 
payable is the amount applicable on that date of receipt. As of a date to be 
set by the President of the EPO, if the international application is filed 
online in character-coded format, no transmittal fee will have to be paid. 
That date will be published in advance in the EPO's Official Journal.

4.2
International filing fee

The international filing fee is collected by the RO/EP for the benefit of the IB 
and its amount is fixed by the IB. It is to be paid within one month from the 
date of receipt of the international application. The amount payable is the 
amount applicable on that date of receipt.

The international filing fee is made up of

–
a fixed amount (the "basic" filing fee part); and

–
an additional amount (the "page fee" part) for each sheet above 30 
(including the abstract, even if missing at the time of filing the 
international application).

Applicants must compute the additional amount themselves and not wait for 
a communication from the EPO, because as from expiry of the one-month 
time limit any missing amount may only be validly paid together with a late 
payment fee (see GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 4.5). For any reductions that may 
apply, see GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 8.1.

The RO/EP will not confirm to the applicants that all fees have been duly 
paid, nor inform them in advance that an overpayment will be refunded 
(e.g. using Form PCT/RO/102).

However, if the RO/EP notes before the expiry of the time limit for payment 
of the relevant fee that the amount paid is not sufficient, it will either 
proceed to debit any missing amount from the applicant's deposit account 
where the applicant has authorised it to do so, or it may informally (e.g. by 
phone) invite the applicant to pay the shortfall before expiry of the time limit. 
If full payment of the amounts due has not been received upon expiry of the

time 
limit, 
the 
RO/EP 
will 
proceed 
as 
described 
under 

GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 4.5.

In the event of overpayment, the RO/EP will inform the applicant by means 
of Form PCT/RO/132 that the refund due has been processed. No 
communication giving advance notice of the refund is sent.

If the application contains a sequence listing as part of the description, the 
pages forming that part are not taken into account for calculating the page 
fee if the following requirements are met:

(i)
the application is filed in electronic form,

(ii)
the sequence listing forming part of the application is filed in XML
format in compliance with WIPO Standard ST.26 (see Annex C to the 
Administrative Instructions under the PCT, paragraph 4).

If any other option for filing a sequence listing is chosen – filing on paper, in 
image format or in another electronic format which is not XML – the 
additional amount of the international filing fee is calculated taking into 
account each page of the sequence listing. If necessary, this additional 
amount is calculated after conversion by the RO/EP of the file into the 
format of the main part of the description. The RO/EP then invites the 
applicant to confirm whether the content of that converted file is intended to 
form part of the description and to pay any corresponding page fee 
(Form PCT/RO/132) within a time limit of one month from the date of the 
invitation. The content of the converted file is not considered part of the 
international application if the applicant so indicates or fails, within that time 
limit, to pay the applicable fees.

4.3
International search fee

The international search fee is collected by the RO/EP for the benefit of the 
EPO as International Searching Authority (ISA/EP) and its amount is fixed 
by the EPO. It is to be paid within one month from the date of receipt of the 
international application. The amount payable is the amount applicable on 
that date of receipt. For any reductions that may apply, see 
GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 8.2.

If the international search fee is not fully paid within the prescribed time 
limit, the RO/EP proceeds as described under GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 4.5.

4.4
Fee for establishment and transmittal to the IB of a certified copy 

of the priority document
The fee for establishment and transmittal to the IB of a certified copy of the 
priority document is paid for the benefit of the RO/EP and applies only if the 
RO/EP is requested by the applicant to prepare and transmit such a copy 
(e.g. by checking the corresponding box in Box VI of the PCT request 
form, PCT/RO/101) and if the earlier priority application was filed before the 
EPO (EP applications or earlier PCT applications filed at the EPO). Its 
amount is fixed by the EPO. It is not due if the applicant requests the IB to 
obtain a certified copy of the priority application from a digital library and

The procedure whereby the EPO includes, free of charge, a copy of the 
earlier application from which priority is claimed in the file of a European 
patent application (cf. GL/EPO A-III, 6.7) does not apply in respect of an 
international application processed by the RO/EP.

4.5
Late payment fee

If the transmittal fee, the international filing fee and the search fee are not 
paid within the prescribed time limits, or if the amounts paid are not 
sufficient to cover the fees due, the RO/EP invites the applicant to pay the 
missing amount together with a late payment fee for its own benefit 
(Form PCT/RO/133). Such payment has to be made within one month from 
the date of the invitation.

The late payment fee is equal to 50% of the amount of the unpaid fee or, if 
the resulting amount is less than the transmittal fee, to an amount equal to 
the transmittal fee. The late payment fee may however not exceed the 
amount of 50% of the international filing fee as specified in the PCT 
Schedule of Fees (without taking into account any fee due for each page of 
the international application in excess of 30 pages).

If the applicant complies with the invitation (Form PCT/RO/133) within the 
indicated time limit, payment is deemed to have been made in due time.

If the applicant pays the fees after the time limit for payment expires but 
before the invitation is issued by the RO/EP (Form PCT/RO133), the 
payment is considered to have been received in time.

Failure to pay the missing amount with the late payment fee within the one-
month time limit set in the invitation (Form PCT/RO/133) will result in the 
international application being considered withdrawn. The RO/EP will so 
declare (Form PCT/RO/117).

Nevertheless, if the applicant pays the fees after the time limit set in the 
invitation expires (Form PCT/RO/133) but before the RO/EP has 
despatched the notification of withdrawal of the international application 
(Form PCT/RO/117), the payment is considered to have been received in 
time and the application will not be considered withdrawn.

4.6
Fee for requesting restoration of priority right

The fee for requesting restoration of priority right is paid for the benefit of 
the RO/EP and its amount is fixed by the EPO. It is to be paid within the 
same time limit as for filing the request for restoration, which is two months 
from expiry of the priority period. The amount payable is the amount 
applicable on the date of receipt of the request for restoration.

Fees to be paid to the ISA/EP

5.1
Additional search fee

The additional search fee paid in response to an invitation to pay additional 
fees 
after 
a 
finding 
of 
lack 
of 
unity 
(Form PCT/ISA/206, 
see 

GL/PCT-EPO B-VII, 6.2) is collected directly by the EPO as International 
Searching Authority (ISA/EP) and its amount is fixed by the EPO. This fee 
is to be paid within one month from the date of the invitation. The amount 
payable is the amount applicable on the date of receipt of the international 
application. 
For 
any 
reductions 
that 
may 
apply, 
see 

GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 8.2.1.

The applicant must also pay the ISA/EP an additional search fee (equal to 
the search fee) where the receiving Office notifies it of a correct element or 
part under Rule 20.5bis PCT after the start of the search and the applicant 
wants the search to be based on that correct element or part. This 
additional fee must be paid within one month from the date of the invitation 
to do so. No additional search fee is to be paid to the ISA/EP under R. 
40bis.1 PCT in the case of missing parts (R. 20.5 PCT).

5.2
Protest fee

The protest fee is paid for the benefit of the ISA/EP and its amount is fixed 
by the EPO. It is to be paid within one month from the date of the invitation 
to pay additional fees after the finding of lack of unity (Form PCT/ISA/206, 
see GL/PCT-EPO B-VII, 6.3). The amount payable is the amount applicable 
on the date of payment.

5.3
Fee for the late furnishing of sequence listings

The late furnishing fee is paid for the benefit of the ISA/EP and its amount 
is fixed by the EPO. It is payable within one month from the date of the 
invitation to furnish the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence listing 
(Form PCT/ISA/225, see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.2). The amount payable is 
the amount applicable on the date of payment.

6.
Fees to be paid if a SIS request is submitted

To obtain a supplementary international search, the supplementary search 
handling fee and the supplementary search fee have to be paid to the IB in 
Swiss francs.

6.1
Supplementary search handling fee

The supplementary search handling fee is collected by the IB for its own 
benefit and its amount is fixed by the IB. The supplementary search 
handling fee is to be paid within one month from the date of receipt of the 
supplementary search request (Form PCT/IB/375). The amount payable is 
the amount applicable on the date of payment. For any reductions that may 
apply, see GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 8.3.

6.2
Supplementary search fee

The supplementary search fee is collected by the IB for the benefit of the 
EPO as Supplementary International Searching Authority (SISA/EP) and its 
amount is fixed by the EPO. It is to be paid within one month from the date

Handling fee

The handling fee is collected by the EPO as International Preliminary 
Examining Authority (IPEA/EP) for the benefit of the IB and its amount is 
fixed by the IB. It is to be paid within one month from the date on which the 
demand (Form PCT/IPEA/401) was submitted or within 22 months from the 
priority date, whichever time limit expires later. The amount payable is the 
amount applicable on the date of payment. For any reductions that may 
apply, see GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 8.3.

If the handling fee is not fully paid within the prescribed time limit, the 
IPEA/EP proceeds as described under GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 7.5.

7.2
Preliminary examination fee

The preliminary examination fee is collected by the IPEA/EP for its own 
benefit and its amount is fixed by the EPO. It is to be paid within one month 
from the date on which the demand (Form PCT/IPEA/401) was submitted 
or within 22 months from the priority date, whichever time limit expires later. 
The amount payable is the amount applicable on the date of payment. For 
any reductions that may apply, see GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 8.4.

If the preliminary examination fee is not fully paid within the prescribed time 
limit, the IPEA/EP proceeds as described under GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 7.5.

7.2.1
Additional preliminary examination fee

The additional preliminary examination fee paid in response to an invitation 
to pay additional examination fees after a finding of lack of unity 
(Form PCT/IPEA/405, see GL/PCT-EPO C-V, 4.2) is collected by the 
IPEA/EP and its amount is fixed by the EPO. It is to be paid within one 
month from the date of the invitation. The amount payable is the amount 
applicable on the date of payment. For any reductions that may apply, see 
GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 8.4.1.

7.3
Protest fee

The protest fee is paid for the benefit of the IPEA/EP and its amount is fixed 
by the EPO. It is payable within one month from the date of the invitation to 
pay additional examination fees after a finding of lack of unity 
(Form PCT/IPEA/405, see GL/PCT-EPO C-V, 4.3). The amount payable is 
the amount applicable on the date of payment.

7.4
Fee for the late furnishing of sequence listings

The late furnishing fee is paid for the benefit of the IPEA/EP and its amount 
is fixed by the EPO. It is payable within one month from the date of the 
invitation to furnish the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence listing 
(Form PCT/IPEA/441, see GL/PCT-EPO C-VIII, 2.1). The amount payable 
is the amount applicable on the date of payment.

7.5
Late payment fee

Where the IPEA/EP finds that the amount paid to it is insufficient to cover 
the handling fee and the international preliminary examination fee or that no 
fees were paid within the time limit for payment, the IPEA/EP invites the 
applicant to pay to it the amount required to cover those fees together with 
a late payment fee, within one month from the date of the invitation 
(Form PCT/IPEA/440).

The late payment fee is 50% of the amount of the unpaid fees as specified 
in the invitation or, if the resulting amount is less than the handling fee, an 
amount equal to the handling fee. The amount of the late payment fee may 
not, however, exceed double the amount of the handling fee.

If the applicant complies with the invitation within the specified time limit, 
payment is deemed to have been made in time (Form PCT/IPEA/440).

If the applicant pays the fees after the time limit for payment expires but 
before the IPEA/EP has despatched the invitation (Form PCT/IPEA/440) to 
the applicant, the payment is considered to have been received in time.

Failure to pay the missing amount and the late payment fee within the time 
limit set in the invitation (Form PCT/IPEA/440) will result in the demand 
being considered as if it had not been submitted, and the EPO will so 
declare (Form PCT/IPEA/407).

If the applicant pays the fees after the time limit set in the invitation expires 
(Form PCT/IPEA/440) but before the IPEA/EP has despatched the 
notification that the demand is considered not to have been submitted 
(Form PCT/IPEA/407), the payment is considered to have been received in 
time and the demand will not be considered as if it had not been submitted.

Part A – Chapter III-8
PCT-EPO Guidelines

8.1.1
Reduction for applications filed in electronic form

The amount of reduction of the international filing fee is set by the IB and is 
applicable on the date of receipt of the international application.

For international applications submitted in electronic form, three different 
levels of reduction apply, depending on the format in which the application 
is filed, namely:

8.1.1.1
Web-form filing (WFF) reduction

This reduction applies if both the request form (PCT/RO/101) and the 
specification (description, claims and abstract) are filed in PDF.

8.1.1.2
PDF reduction

This reduction applies if the request form (PCT/RO/101) is filed in 
character-coded format (XML), while the specification (description, claims 
and abstract) is filed in PDF.

8.1.1.3
XML reduction

This reduction applies if both the request form (PCT/RO/101) and the 
specification (description, claims and abstract) are filed in character-coded 
format (XML).

8.1.2
Reductions for applicants from certain states

The international filing fee is reduced by 90% if the requirements stipulated 
in point 5 of the PCT Schedule of Fees are met.

For filings at the RO/EP, the reduction applies only if the applicant is a 
natural person who is a national of and resides in an EPC contracting state 
complying with the criteria under point 5(a) PCT Schedule of Fees (an 
updated list can be found in the Euro-PCT Guide, point 2.25.019).

If the application is filed with the RO/EP by more than one applicant, only 
one of them needs to be a national and resident of one of the EPC 
contracting states in question, but each applicant must fulfil the criteria 
mentioned under point 5 of the PCT Schedule of Fees.

The 90% reduction is calculated after deduction of the electronic filing 
reduction, if applicable (see GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 8.1.1).

8.2
Reduction of the international search fee

The fee for the international search on an international application is 
reduced by 75% where the applicant or, if there are two or more applicants, 
each applicant is

–
a natural person who is a national and resident of a state not party to 
the EPC which on the date of filing of the application is classified as a 
low-income or lower-middle-income economy by the World Bank;

or

–
a natural or legal person who is a national and resident of a state in 
which a validation agreement with the EPO is in force.

8.2.1
Reduction of the additional search fee

If the applicant fulfils the requirements for reduction of the international 
search fee, any additional search fee is validly paid upon payment of the 
reduced amount.

8.3
Reduction of the (supplementary search) handling fee

The handling fee is reduced by 90% under the same conditions as for the 
international filing fee (see GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 8.1.2). This principle also 
applies to the supplementary search handling fee due under Rule 45bis.2.

8.4
Reduction of the preliminary examination fee

The fee for international preliminary examination is reduced by 75% under 
the same conditions as for the reduction of the international search fee 
(GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 8.2).

8.4.1
Reduction of the additional preliminary examination fee

If the applicant fulfils the requirements for reduction of the preliminary 
examination fee, any additional preliminary examination fee is validly paid 
upon payment of the reduced amount.

9.
Refund of fees

Refunds are made to a deposit account held with the EPO or to a bank 
account. Since 1 April 2019 the EPO has no longer made refunds by 
cheque, and the EPO does not make refunds to credit cards. In general, 
the EPO will refund fees to any deposit account that the party to the 
proceedings before it indicates in its refund instructions. Parties are 
therefore also able to indicate a deposit account held by a third party. In the 
event of a discrepancy between the name of the deposit account holder 
and the account number indicated, the account number will prevail. Under 
the fee refund procedures applicable since 1 October 2019, up-to-date 
refund instructions must be filed in an electronically processable format 
(XML). If the EPO cannot make a refund to a deposit account held with it, 
the refund will be made to a bank account. In this case, the party will be 
invited to claim the refund via the EPO website. For accounts within the 
Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), the only details required will be the 
IBAN and the name of the account holder. For non-SEPA bank transfers, 
parties may need to provide more information depending on the country to 
which the refund is to be transferred. The EPO will pay the transfer fees.

If parties would like all their refunds to be made to a deposit account held 
with the EPO, they will have to submit separate refund instructions to that 
effect for all applications concerned. Refund instructions filed for an 
international application before the EPO as RO or as an International 
Authority under the PCT will apply only to refunds due in the international 
phase. Detailed guidance on how and when to file refund instructions is 
provided in OJ EPO 2019, A82.

OJ EPO 2020, A4

OJ EPO 2022, A18
OJ EPO 2019, A82


Part A – Chapter III-10
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

Fees paid by mistake or without cause (e.g. because the EPO is not the 
competent RO or IPEA) will be refunded. Any amount paid in excess of the 
amount due is likewise refunded.

Rights for the refunding of fees paid in excess extinguish after four years 
from the end of the calendar year in which the right originally arose, unless 
a written reasoned claim is filed.

In addition, the following refunds may apply:

9.1
Refund of the international filing fee

The international filing fee is refunded where

–
no date of filing can be accorded; or

–
the application is withdrawn or considered withdrawn before its 
transmittal to the IB.

9.2
Refund of the (additional) international search fee

The international search fee is refunded where

–
no date of filing can be accorded; or

–
the international application is withdrawn or considered withdrawn 
before its transmittal to the ISA; or

–
the international application is withdrawn or considered withdrawn 
before the start of the international search; or

–
the EPO can base the ISR partly or entirely on an earlier search that 
it has performed on an application whose priority is validly claimed 
for the international application. The (additional) search fee paid will 
be refunded in part or in full depending upon the extent to which the 
EPO 
benefits 
from 
the 
earlier 
search. 
See 
also 

GL/PCT-EPO B-IV, 1.1.

The EPO acting as ISA decides whether the requirements are met and, 
where applicable, refunds the applicable amount. No refund is made for 
any search other than a search carried out by the EPO on an earlier 
application from which the right of priority is validly claimed.

The cases referred to below are intended to illustrate the most common 
situations:

9.2.1
Examples of refunds

9.2.1.1
Full refund

The "full refund" level applies where the EPO can make full use of the 
earlier search report for drawing up the international search report.

This occurs, in particular, where the claims of the earlier and the later 
application are identical or where the claims of the later application are

limited with respect to those of the earlier application, this limitation being 
due to

(a)
the deletion of alternative features from an independent claim or

(b)
the introduction of one or more limiting features into one or more of 
the independent claims of the later application where the limiting 
feature(s) was/were all contained in a dependent claim referring back 
to said independent claim(s) in the earlier application.

9.2.1.2
Partial refund

The "partial refund" level applies where the EPO can make partial use of 
the earlier search report for drawing up the international search report.

This occurs, in particular, where

(a)
the claims of the later application are broader than those of the 
earlier application and this broadening represents a further 
generalisation of the same invention as that searched in the earlier 
application, or

(b)
the claims of the later application are limited with respect to those of 
the earlier application, due to a limiting feature not disclosed in the 
earlier application but relating to the same invention as that searched 
in the earlier application.

The international search fee is refunded as follows:

–
25% in the case of an earlier search with written opinion;

–
17.5% in the case of an earlier search without a written opinion.

9.2.1.3
No refund

No refund is due

(a)
where the subject-matter claimed in the later application represents 
an invention different from that searched in the earlier application, or

(b)
the legal requirements for a refund are not fulfilled, for example 
where the priority of the earlier application is not validly claimed.

9.3
Refund of additional search fees and, where applicable, the 

protest fee
If the Review Panel finds that a protest was entirely justified, the additional
search fees and the protest fee will be refunded.

If it finds that the protest was justified only in part, the corresponding 
additional search fees will be refunded, but not the protest fee (see 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VII, 7.2).

9.4
Refund of the supplementary search fee

The EPO as SISA will refund the supplementary search fee where,

–
before it has started the supplementary search, the supplementary 
search request is considered not to have been submitted; or

–
before it has started the supplementary search, the international 
application or the supplementary search request is withdrawn.

9.5
Refund of the review fee

If the Review Panel finds that the lack of unity objection was not justified, 
the review fee is refunded to the applicant (see GL/PCT-EPO B-XII, 10.4).

9.6
Refund of the handling fee

Where the demand for international preliminary examination is withdrawn 
before it has been sent by the IPEA/EP to the IB, or where the demand is 
considered not to have been submitted, 100% of the handling fee is 
refunded.

9.7
Refund of the preliminary examination fee

Where the international application or the demand for international 
preliminary examination is withdrawn before examination has commenced 
and within 30 months from the priority date, or where the demand is 
considered not to have been submitted, 100% of the fee for international 
preliminary examination is refunded.

9.8
Refund of additional examination fees and, where applicable, the 

protest fee
If the Review Panel finds that a protest was entirely justified, the additional 
examination fees and the protest fee will be refunded.

If it finds that the protest was justified only in part, the corresponding 
additional examination fees will be refunded, but not the protest fee (see 
GL/PCT-EPO C-V, 5.2).

1.
PCT Direct service (see also GL/PCT-EPO B-IV, 1.2)

1.1
General remarks

When filing an international application claiming priority from an earlier 
national, European or international application already searched by the 
EPO (i.e. a "doublure"; see GL/PCT-EPO B-IV, 1.1), the applicant may 
submit to any receiving Office informal comments aimed at reacting to the 
objections raised in the search opinion established by the EPO for the 
priority application. At the EPO, this service is called "PCT Direct".

Such informal comments are to be understood as arguments regarding the 
patentability of the claims of the international application and also possibly 
as explanations regarding any modifications to the application documents, 
in particular to the claims, in comparison with the priority application. If the 
requirements under GL/PCT-EPO A-IV, 1.2, are met, the informal 
comments will be taken into account by the EPO as ISA when it establishes 
the international search report and written opinion for the international 
application.

For the processing of applications under the PCT Direct service by the EPO 
as ISA, see GL/PCT-EPO B-IV, 1.2.

1.2
Form of submissions

Applicants may request to have their international application processed 
under the PCT Direct service by filing a letter ("PCT Direct letter") 
containing informal comments aimed at overcoming objections raised in the 
search opinion established by the EPO for the priority application. The 
earlier application from which priority is claimed must have been searched 
by the EPO (international, European or national first filing, but not an 
international-type search).

The PCT Direct letter is to be presented as a separate document attached 
to the international application; it should be entitled "PCT Direct/informal 
comments" and clearly identify in the header the application number of the 
earlier application. The PCT Direct letter does not form part of the 
international application.

If the claims and/or the description of the international application differ 
from the earlier application, preferably a marked-up copy indicating the 
differences should be submitted. A copy of the earlier search opinion could 
also be annexed to the PCT Direct letter. It should be borne in mind that the 
letter, together with the annexed documents, will be made available to the 
public in accordance with the provisions on file inspection.

The PCT Direct letter, any marked-up copy of the claims and/or description, 
as well as the earlier search opinion, if annexed, are to be submitted as a 
single document in PDF (not as a ZIP file) and indicated in Box IX of the 
PCT request form (Form PCT/RO/101). In particular, the words "PCT 
Direct/informal comments" should be specified under point 11, "other", for 
filings on paper. When filing in electronic form using the EPO Online Filing 

OJ EPO 2017, A21


Part A – Chapter IV-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

software, the PCT Direct letter needs to be attached as an accompanying 
item "Applicant letter to ISA concerning earlier search ("PCT Direct")". For 
filings in electronic form using Online Filing 2.0 or WIPO's ePCT portal, the 
PCT Direct letter and any marked-up copy of the claims and/or description 
are to be uploaded under the section "International Search" – "Use of 
earlier search and classification results" – "Availability of document(s) to the 
ISA" – "Other document(s) attached" – "Add other Document" by selecting
Document Type "Applicant letter to ISA concerning earlier search ("PCT 
Direct")". Irrespective of the online filing software used, the correct 
document is automatically reflected in the generated XML and PDF, which 
show in section IX-10 the PCT Direct letter as an attachment under "Other".

Informal comments filed under PCT Direct must be self-contained. Third 
parties must be able to fully understand these comments as they stand. If 
explicit references are made to the search opinion for the first filing, that 
search opinion should be annexed to the international application. The 
reason for this requirement is that the search report, the search opinion or 
any other submissions that are part of the file of the earlier application may 
not be publicly available.

1.3
Processing by the EPO as RO

The PCT Direct letter and its annexes are transmitted to the EPO as ISA 
and to the IB, together with, respectively, the search copy and the record 
copy.

The PCT Direct letter and its annexes are made available to the public via 
file inspection in the European Patent Register and on WIPO's 
PATENTSCOPE.

For details on the procedure in the event of missing indications or missing 
informal comments, see GL/RO 116F and 116G.

For information on the procedure if informal comments are submitted after 
the filing of the international application, see GL/RO 116H.

1.4
Processing by the EPO as ISA

For the procedure followed by the EPO as ISA when assessing a PCT 
Direct request, see GL/PCT-EPO B-IV, 1.2.2.

2.
Withdrawals

2.1
General remarks

Applicants may withdraw their international application, one or more 
designations, priority claims, their request for supplementary international 
search, their demand or any or all elections by filing a notice of withdrawal 
within the prescribed time limits. Any such withdrawal is free of charge.

A notice of withdrawal must be signed by the applicant or, if there are two 
or more applicants, by all of them. It may instead be signed, on behalf of 
the applicant(s), by the duly appointed agent or common representative, 
but not by the "deemed" common representative under Rule 90.2(b). If the

March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part A – Chapter IV-3

agent or the common representative has not yet been duly appointed, a 
power of attorney signed by all the applicants has to be submitted together 
with the notice of withdrawal; the requirement to submit a power of attorney 
to the EPO is not waived in such cases. If such a power of attorney is not 
filed together with the notice of withdrawal, the EPO will request the 
applicant(s) to submit one and the withdrawal will take effect on the date of 
its receipt. If no power of attorney is received before the expiration of the 
time limit for filing a withdrawal, the request for withdrawal will not be 
processed.

Moreover, the EPO will only process unqualified and unambiguous notices 
of withdrawal. If in doubt, the EPO will seek clarification of the applicant's or 
applicants' intention before any action is undertaken.

2.2
Withdrawal of the international application

Applicants may address a notice of withdrawal of their international 
application to the IB, the RO or, where a demand has been filed, to the 
IPEA, and may do so at any time prior to the expiration of 30 months from 
the priority date.

The EPO as RO or IPEA will mark the notice of withdrawal of the 
international application with the date on which it was received and 
promptly transmit it to the IB.

For information on the refund of the international filing fee in the event of 
withdrawal of the international application, see GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 9.1; for 
information on the refund of the international search fee, see 
GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 9.2.

2.2.1
Conditional withdrawal

Applicants may request the withdrawal of their international application on 
condition that the international publication can be prevented ("conditional 
withdrawal"). In such a case, the withdrawal does not become effective if 
the condition cannot be met, that is, if the IB has already completed the 
technical preparations for the international publication. It is recommended 
that conditional withdrawals be submitted direct to the IB, especially if the 
date of completion of the technical preparations is imminent.

2.3
Withdrawal of designations

An applicant may address a notice of withdrawal of any designations to the 
IB, the RO or, where a demand has been filed, the IPEA, and may do so at 
any time prior to the expiration of 30 months from the priority date. 
Withdrawal of the designation of all designated states is treated as 
withdrawal of the international application (see GL/PCT-EPO A-IV, 2.2). 
Withdrawal of a designated state which has been elected entails withdrawal 
of the corresponding election (see GL/PCT-EPO A-IV, 2.6). If the 
withdrawal of a designation reaches the IB prior to completion of the 
technical preparations for publication, the designation in question is not 
published.

2.4
Withdrawal of priority claims

An applicant may address a notice of withdrawal of one or more priority 
claims to the IB, the RO or, where a demand has been filed, to the IPEA, 
and may do so at any time prior to the expiration of 30 months from the 
priority date.

Where the priority date of the international application has changed 
following withdrawal of a priority claim, any time limit which is computed 
from the original priority date, and which has not already expired, is 
recomputed from the priority date resulting from that change. Time limits 
computed from the original priority date which have already expired are not 
reinstated (Rule 90bis.3(d)). Nevertheless the IB may proceed with the 
international publication based on the original priority date if the notice of 
withdrawal of a priority claim reaches the IB after completion of the 
technical preparations for publication (Rule 90bis.3(e)).

The EPO acting as RO or as IPEA will mark the notice of withdrawal with 
the date on which it was received and promptly transmit it to the IB.

2.5
Withdrawal of the supplementary search request

Applicants may withdraw their request for supplementary international 
search by addressing a notice of withdrawal to either the IB or the authority 
specified for the supplementary search, and may do so at any time before 
transmittal by the SISA of the supplementary international search report or 
of the declaration that no such report will be established. The EPO as SISA 
will mark the notice of withdrawal with the date on which it was received 
and promptly transmit it to the IB. For information on the refund of the 
supplementary international search fee by the EPO as SISA, see 
GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 9.4.

2.6
Withdrawal of the demand or of elections

Applicants may withdraw their demand or any or all elections by addressing 
a notice of withdrawal to the IB, and may do so at any time prior to the 
expiration of 30 months from the priority date. The withdrawal takes effect 
on the date of receipt of the notice by the IB, the IPEA being notified of that 
date. If the applicant nevertheless submits the notice of withdrawal to the 
IPEA, the IPEA will mark the date of receipt on the notice and transmit it 
promptly to the IB. The notice is considered to have been submitted to the 
IB on the date marked by the IPEA.

Where the demand or all elections are withdrawn, the IPEA is notified of the 
withdrawal by the IB and the processing of the international application by 
the IPEA is discontinued.

The demand or the copy thereof must be transmitted to the IB even where 
it has been withdrawn by the applicant. For information on the refund of the 
handling fee, see GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 9.6; for information on the refund of 
the preliminary examination fee in the event of withdrawal of the demand, 
see GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 9.7.

An international application must contain drawings where they are 
necessary to understand the invention. Where they are not, but the nature 
of the invention admits of illustration by drawings, they are optional.

1.
Graphic forms of presentation considered to be drawings

1.1
Technical drawings

Perspectives, exploded views, sections and cross-sections and details on a 
different scale are all considered to be drawings. So too are flow sheets 
and diagrams, such as functional diagrams and graphic representations of 
a given phenomenon which express the relationship between two or more 
parameters.

Where tables or chemical or mathematical formulae are included in the 
description, claims or abstract, they are not considered to be drawings and 
are thus not subject to the requirements for drawings. However, such 
graphic forms may be submitted as drawings, in which case they are.

Where such graphic forms of presentation are not submitted as drawings, 
see GL/PCT-EPO A-V, 11.

1.2
Photographs or coloured drawings

The PCT makes no express provision for photographs or coloured 
drawings and, furthermore, according to Rule 11.13, drawings must be 
executed in durable, black, sufficiently dense and dark, uniformly thick and 
well-defined lines and strokes without colourings. Photographs and 
coloured drawings may, however, exceptionally be submitted where it is 
impossible to present in a black-and-white drawing what is to be shown. If 
colours are necessary to discern details, note that these details may be lost 
when the image is made available in black and white in the publication and 
via file inspection.

For further details see GL/EPO A-IX, 1.2.

2.
Presentation of drawings

2.1
Grouping of drawings

Drawings must be presented on one or more separate sheets. All the 
figures constituting the drawings must be grouped together on a sheet or 
sheets without waste of space, but clearly separated from each other. 
Figures should not be separated by lines. The request, the description, the 
claims and the abstract must not contain drawings.

2.2
Reproducibility of drawings

Drawings must be so presented as to admit of direct reproduction by 
photography, electrostatic processes, photo offset and microfilming, in any 
number of copies.

2.3
Figure accompanying the abstract

Where the international application contains drawings, the applicant must 
indicate, in the check list on the request form (Form PCT/RO/101), the 
number of the figure in the drawings which they suggest be published with 
the abstract.

The figure published with the abstract must be the one which best 
characterises the claimed invention and must be chosen from the drawings 
accompanying the international application. Generally, only one figure 
should be indicated. The abstract may exceptionally be illustrated by more 
than one figure where necessary information cannot be otherwise 
conveyed. A figure containing significant amounts of text should be 
avoided.

3.
Requirements regarding the paper used

If the international application is filed on paper, drawings must be on sheets 
of A4 paper (29.7 cm x 21 cm), which must be flexible, strong, white, 
smooth, non-shiny and durable. The sheets must be free from creases and 
cracks; they must not be folded. Only one side of each sheet may be used.

Under Rule 11.12, each sheet must be reasonably free from erasures and 
must be free from alterations, overwriting and interlineations. Non-
compliance with this rule may be authorised if the authenticity of the 
content is not in question and the requirements for good reproduction are 
not in jeopardy.

4.
Presentation of the sheets of drawings

4.1
Usable surface area of sheets

On sheets containing drawings, the surface usable must not exceed 
26.2 cm x 17.0 cm. The sheets must not contain frames around the usable 
or used surface. The minimum margins are as follows: top: 2.5 cm; left 
side: 2.5 cm; right side: 1.5 cm; bottom: 1 cm.

4.2
Numbering of sheets of drawings

All the sheets of the international application must be numbered in 
consecutive Arabic numerals. All sheets of drawings must be numbered in 
the centre of either the top or the bottom of the sheet but not in the margin, 
in numbers larger than those used as reference signs.

Sheets of drawings must be numbered as a separate series commencing 
with the first; the number of each sheet must consist of two Arabic 
numerals separated by an oblique stroke, the first being the sheet number 
and the second being the total number of sheets of drawings (for example: 
1/3, 2/3, 3/3).

5.
General layout of drawings

If various figures are presented on the same sheet of drawings, they must 
be laid out according to the requirements for page-setting and numbering, 
and figures divided into several parts must comply with the requirements 
described in the subsections below.

5.1
Page-setting

The figures must be arranged on a sheet or sheets without wasting space, 
preferably in an upright position and clearly separated from one another. 
Where a figure cannot be presented satisfactorily in an upright position, it 
may be placed sideways with the top of the figure at the left side of the 
sheet. Thus, a figure which is broader than it is high may be set out so that 
the bottom of the figure lies parallel to and along the right-hand side of the 
sheet. In this case, if other figures are drawn on the same sheet, they 
should be set out in the same way, so that all the figures on a single sheet 
lie in the same position.

5.2
Numbering of figures

The figures on the sheets of drawings must be numbered in Arabic 
numerals, consecutively, independently of the numbering of the sheets and, 
if possible, in the order in which they appear. The numbers of the figures 
should be preceded by "Fig.", irrespective of the language of the 
international application. Where a single figure is sufficient to illustrate the 
claimed invention, it should not be numbered and "Fig." should not appear. 
Numbers and letters identifying the figures must be simple and clear and 
may not be used in association with brackets, circles or inverted commas, 
except in the case of partial figures intended to form one complete figure, 
irrespective of whether they appear on one or several sheets. In this case 
the complete figure may be identified by the same number followed by a 
capital letter (for example: Fig. 7B).

The figures should preferably be set out, as far as possible, on each sheet 
in ascending numerical order from left to right and from top to bottom. If one 
of two figures illustrates on a larger scale a detail from the other, each 
figure should be numbered separately and, if possible, consecutively.

5.3
Whole figure

One sheet of drawings may contain several figures. Where figures on two 
or more sheets form in effect a single complete figure, the figures on the 
several sheets must be so arranged that the complete figure can be 
assembled without concealing any part of any of the figures appearing on 
the various sheets.

Partial figures drawn on separate sheets must always be capable of being 
linked edge to edge, that is to say, no partial figure may contain parts of 
another partial figure. A very long figure may be divided into several parts 
placed one above the other on a single sheet. However, the relationship 
between the different parts must be clear and unambiguous. It is therefore 
recommended that a smaller scale figure be included showing the whole 
formed by the partial figures and indicating the positions of the parts shown.

6.
Prohibited matter

As set out in Rule 9.1(i) and (ii), the international application must not 
contain drawings contrary to morality or public order. If it does, the 
applicant may be invited to voluntarily correct it (Rule 9.2).

7.
Execution of drawings

7.1
Drawings of lines and strokes

The drawings must be executed in durable, black, uniformly thick and 
well-defined lines and strokes. See GL/PCT-EPO A-V, 1.2, in respect of 
colour drawings, where these are exceptionally submitted. In all cases, the 
thickness of the lines and strokes must take into account the scale, nature, 
execution and perfect legibility of the drawing and of the reproductions. All 
lines in the drawings must, ordinarily, be drawn with the aid of a drafting 
instrument, except for those which by their nature do not permit the use of 
such instruments, for example irregular diagrams, ornamental structures 
and curved reference lines.

7.2
Shading

The use of shading in figures is allowed provided this assists in 
understanding them and is not so extensive as to impede legibility. Shading 
may, for instance, be used to indicate the shape of spherical, cylindrical or 
conical elements. Flat parts may also be lightly shaded. Such shading is 
allowed in the case of parts shown in perspective but not for cross-sections. 
Only spaced lines may be used for shading, not fully blacked out areas. 
These lines must be thin and as few in number as possible and contrast 
with the rest of the drawings.

7.3
Cross-sections

7.3.1
Sectional figures

Where a figure is a cross-section of another figure, the latter should 
indicate the position of the section and may indicate the viewing direction 
by arrows at each end. In addition, in order to allow each sectional figure to 
be quickly identified, especially where several cross-sections are made of 
the same figure, each end of the cross-section line should be marked on 
the diagram with the same single Arabic or Roman numeral which identifies 
the figure in which the section is illustrated.

7.3.2
Hatching

A cross-section must be set out and drawn in the same manner as a 
normal view whose parts in cross-section are hatched with regularly spaced 
parallel oblique strokes, the space between the strokes being chosen on 
the basis of the total area to be hatched. Hatching should not impede the 
clear reading of the reference signs and reference lines. Consequently, if it 
is not possible to place reference signs outside the hatched area, the 
hatching may be broken off wherever reference signs are inserted. Certain 
types of hatching may be given a specific meaning. The hatching should be 
at a substantial angle to the surrounding axes or principal lines, preferably 
45º. The various parts of a cross-section of the same item should be 
hatched in the same manner. The hatching of juxtaposed different elements 
should be angled in a different way. In the case of large areas, hatching

can be confined to an edging drawn around the inside of the outline of the 
area to be hatched.

7.4
Scale of drawings

The scale of the drawings and the distinctness of their graphical execution 
must be such that a photographic reproduction with a linear reduction in 
size to two-thirds would enable all details to be distinguished without 
difficulty. In exceptional cases, where required, the scale of the drawing 
may be graphically represented.

7.5
Numbers, letters and reference signs

Numbers, letters, reference signs and any other data given on the sheets of 
drawings, such as the numbering of figures and of the sheets, acceptable 
text matter, graduations on scales, etc., must be simple and clear, and not 
used in association with any brackets, inverted commas, circles or outlines 
whatsoever. Signs indicating minutes, seconds or degrees are permitted. 
Numbers, letters and reference signs should be laid out in the same 
direction as the diagram so as to avoid having to rotate the sheet. They 
should not be placed in the closed and complex parts of the drawings so as 
to interfere with a thorough comprehension of the drawings, and therefore 
should rarely cross or mingle with the lines. As a general rule, numbers, 
letters and reference signs should be placed as close as possible to the 
part in question.

7.5.1
Leading lines

Reference lines (also referred to as leading lines), that is, lines between the 
reference signs (for example, reference numerals) and the details referred 
to, may be straight or curved and should be as short as possible. They 
must originate in the immediate proximity of the reference sign and extend 
to the feature indicated. Reference lines for certain reference signs may be 
omitted. Reference signs of this type, which are not connected to anything, 
will then indicate the surface or cross-section on which they are placed. In 
such cases the reference sign may be underlined to make it clear that the 
line has not been left out by mistake. Reference lines must be executed in 
the same way as other lines in the drawing.

7.5.2
Arrows

Arrows may be used at the end of the reference lines provided that their 
meaning is clear.

–
A free-standing arrow indicates the entire section towards which it 
points.

–
An arrow touching a line indicates the surface shown by the line 
looking along the direction of the arrow.

–
Arrows may also be used in appropriate cases to show the direction 
of movement.

7.5.3
Height of the numbers and letters in the drawings

The height of the numbers and letters must not be less than 0.32 cm. For 
the lettering of drawings, the Latin or, where customary, the Greek alphabet 
must be used.

7.5.4
Consistent use of reference signs in the description, claims 

and drawings
Reference signs must be used in a manner which is consistent in the 
description, claims and drawings. In particular, reference signs not 
mentioned in the description must not appear in the drawings, and vice 
versa.

A feature denoted by a reference sign must be denoted by the same sign 
throughout the international application.

In the case of international applications dealing with complex subjects and 
incorporating a large number of drawings, a separate sheet listing all the 
reference signs should be included at the end of the description as a part of 
it.

7.5.5
Consistent use of reference signs in the drawings

A feature denoted by a reference sign must be denoted by the same sign 
throughout the international application.

7.6
Variations in proportions

Each element of each figure must be in proper proportion to each of the 
other elements in the figure, except where the use of a different proportion 
is indispensable for the clarity of the figure.

8.
Text matter in drawings

The drawings must not contain text matter, except a single word or words 
when absolutely indispensable, such as "water", "steam", "open", "closed", 
"section on AB" and, in the case of electric circuits and block schematic or 
flow sheet diagrams, a few short catchwords indispensable for 
understanding. Any words used must be so placed that, if translated, they 
may be pasted over without interfering with any lines of the drawings.

Any text matter which is indispensable must comply with the requirements 
for the writing of text matter.

For indications of the type "section on AB", see GL/PCT-EPO A-V, 7.3.1.

Where any text matter of the drawings is filed in a language which is 
different from the language of the description and the claims, the receiving 
Office will invite the applicant to furnish a translation of the text matter of 
the drawings into the language in which the international application is to be 
published (Rule 26.3ter). The receiving Office decides whether the 
correction was submitted within the two-month time limit under Rule 26.2
and, if so, whether the international application so corrected is or is not to 
be considered withdrawn. However, no international application may be 
considered withdrawn for lack of compliance with the physical requirements

referred to in Rule 11 if it complies with them to the extent necessary for the 
purpose of reasonably uniform international publication (Rule 26.5).

9.
Conventional symbols

Known devices may be illustrated by symbols which have a universally 
recognised conventional meaning and are generally accepted in the art 
provided no further detail is essential for understanding the subject-matter 
of the claimed invention. Other signs and symbols may be used provided 
that they are not likely to be confused with existing conventional symbols, 
that they are readily identifiable (i.e. simple) and that they are clearly 
explained in the text of the description. Different types of hatching may also 
have different conventional meanings as regards the nature of a material 
seen in cross-section.

10. Amendments to drawings
The drawings can be amended during the international phase only if the 
applicant files a demand for international preliminary examination. See 
GL/PCT-EPO H-I, 3.

For the rectification of obvious mistakes, see GL/PCT-EPO B-III, 2.3.2, and 
H-I, 2. For the addition of an entire sheet of drawings omitted on the date of 
filing, see GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 5.

If the drawings submitted on the date of filing do not comply with the 
requirements in Rule 11 to the extent necessary for the purpose of 
reasonably uniform international publication, the EPO as receiving Office 
will invite the applicant to submit a correction within two months of the 
invitation (Form PCT/RO/106). If the EPO as receiving Office finds that the 
defects have not been corrected or have not been corrected on time, it will
declare the international application withdrawn (Form PCT/RO/117). An 
international application may not be considered withdrawn for lack of 
compliance with the physical requirements in Rule 11 if it complies with 
them to the extent necessary for the purpose of reasonably uniform 
international publication.

11. Graphic forms of presentation not considered to be drawings
Where tables or chemical or mathematical formulae are included in the 
description, claims or abstract, they are not considered to be drawings and 
are thus not subject to the requirements for drawings.

11.1 Chemical and mathematical formulae
The description, the claims and the abstract may contain chemical or 
mathematical formulae. Such formulae may be written by hand or drawn if 
necessary but it is recommended that appropriate drafting aids or materials, 
such as stencils or transfers, be used. For practical reasons formulae may 
be grouped together on one or more sheets in the description and 
paginated with it. In such cases, it is recommended that each formula be 
designated by a reference sign and that the description contain references 
to the formulae whenever necessary.

Chemical or mathematical formulae must employ symbols in general use 
and must be drawn in such a way that they are completely unambiguous.

Numerals, letters and signs which are not typed must be legible and 
identical in form in the various formulae, irrespective of the element of the 
international application in which they appear. Chemical or mathematical 
formulae appearing in the text of the international application must have 
symbols, the capital letters of which are at least 0.28 cm high. Where they 
appear on sheets of drawings, these symbols must be at least 0.32 cm 
high. All mathematical symbols used in a formula which appear in the 
description or on sheets of drawings should be explained in the description, 
unless their significance is clear from the context. In any case, the 
mathematical symbols used may be collated in a list.

11.2 Tables

11.2.1 Tables in the description
The description may contain tables. For the sake of convenience, tables 
may be grouped together on one or more sheets of the description and 
paginated with it. If two or more tables are necessary, each should be 
identified by a Roman numeral (independently of the pagination of the 
description or drawings or of the figure numbering), by a capital letter, by a 
title indicating its content or by some other means. Each line and column in 
a table should begin with an entry explaining what it represents and, if 
necessary, the units used. As far as possible, all tables should be set out 
upright on the sheets. Where the tables cannot be presented satisfactorily 
in an upright position, they may be placed sideways, with the top of the 
tables on the left-hand side of the sheet.

11.2.2 Tables in the claims
The claims may include tables if this is desirable in view of the 
subject-matter involved. In such cases, the tables must be included in the 
text of the relevant claim; they may not be annexed to the claims nor may 
reference be made to tables contained in the description.

Chapter VI – Examination of formal 
requirements

1.
Claim to priority

This section is intended to summarise all formal requirements relating to 
priority claims in international applications. In the present edition, it focuses 
on formal requirements under Rule 4.10, defects in priority claims and 
corrections upon invitation as well as restoration of the priority right. It also 
provides additional information on the applicant's entitlement to claim 
priority under Article 87 EPC in the European phase before the EPO. 
Further relevant aspects will gradually be added in successive editions. For 
further information see GL/PCT-EPO F-VI.

1.1
Formal requirements under Rule 4.10

In an international application, the applicant may claim the priority of one or 
more earlier applications. The claim needs to be made in the PCT request 
form (PCT/RO/101) and fulfil the following requirements:

(a)
The earlier application must have been filed in or for a country which 
is party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial 
Property ("Paris Convention") or in or for any member of the World 
Trade Organization that is not party to the Paris Convention.

(b)
The priority claim must indicate:

(i)
the date on which the earlier application was filed;

(ii)
the number of the earlier application;

(iii)
where the earlier application is a national application, the 
country in which it was filed;

(iv)
where the earlier application is a regional application, the 
authority with which the earlier application was filed and that is 
entrusted with the granting of regional patents under the 
applicable regional patent treaty;

(v)
where the earlier application is an international application, the 
receiving Office with which it was filed.

(c)
Where the earlier application is a regional application or an 
international application, the applicant may, if desired, also indicate 
one or more countries party to the Paris Convention for which that 
earlier application was filed, even if this is not required by Rule 
4.10(b)(ii). An indication of at least one country party to the Paris 
Convention or one member of the World Trade Organization for 
which the earlier application was filed is mandatory where the earlier 
application is a regional application filed with ARIPO.

PCT AG I 5.057 ff.
GL/RO 166 ff.
GL/ISPE 6.03


Part A – Chapter VI-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

The words "in or for" any country or member mean that the earlier 
application the priority of which is claimed may be an earlier national, 
regional or international application. The earlier application may be for a 
patent or for the registration of a utility model or for an inventor's certificate.

1.2
Priority period

The date on which the earlier application was filed must fall within the 
priority period of 12 months preceding the international filing date. 
However, if the international filing date lies after, but within two months of, 
that period's expiry, a priority claim will not be considered void for the 
purposes of the international phase of the PCT procedure, irrespective of 
whether 
restoration 
of 
the 
right 
of 
priority 
is 
requested 
(see 

GL/PCT-EPO A-VI, 1.5).

The priority period starts on the day following the date of filing of the earlier 
application. The RO/EP will thus not accept a priority claim relating to an 
application having the same date of filing as the international application 
and will inform the applicant that the claim will be disregarded unless the 
priority date can be corrected (PCT/RO/110; see GL/PCT-EPO A-VI, 1.4.1).

If the last day of the priority period falls on a day on which the EPO is not 
open for the receipt of documents or on which no mail is delivered due to 
an official holiday or other circumstance described in Rule 80.5, it expires 
on the next subsequent day on which none of these circumstances exists. 
However, the priority period may not be extended under Rule 82 or 
Rule 82quater in the event of irregularities in the mail service.

1.3
Inconsistency in the priority claim

Any indication in the priority claim must be consistent with the 
corresponding indication appearing in the priority document. However, if an 
indication in the priority claim is inconsistent with the corresponding 
indication in the priority document, the claim is not considered void for the 
purposes of the international phase of the PCT procedure. Instead, in such 
cases the RO draws applicants' attention to the inconsistency and invites 
them to correct the priority claim accordingly (PCT/RO/110; see 
GL/PCT-EPO A-VI, 1.4.1).

1.4
Defects in the priority claim

Where the RO finds that

–
a priority claim does not comply with the requirements of Rule 4.10
(see GL/PCT-EPO A-VI, 1.1), or that

–
the filing date indicated for the earlier application does not fall within 
the period of 12 months preceding the international filing date (see 
GL/PCT-EPO A-VI, 1.2, and GL/PCT-EPO A-VI, 1.4.2), or that

–
any indication in a priority claim is inconsistent with the 
corresponding indication appearing in the priority document (see 
GL/PCT-EPO A-VI, 1.3, and GL/PCT-EPO A-VI, 1.4.2),

the RO, using Form PCT/RO/110,

(i)
invites the applicant to correct the priority claim (PCT/RO/110, Annex 
A), and/or

(ii)
if the filing date of the international application lies within two months 
of expiry of the priority period, draws the applicant's attention to the 
possibility of requesting restoration of the right of priority 
(PCT/RO/110, Annex B).

1.4.1
Correction of the priority claim upon invitation

The RO will invite the applicant to correct defects in a priority claim 
(indicated in Annex A of Form PCT/RO/110) within a time limit of 16 months 
from the priority date or, where the correction would cause a change in the 
priority date, 16 months from the priority date as so changed, whichever 
expires first, provided that a notice of correction may, in any event, be 
submitted until the expiry of four months from the international filing date.

Upon receipt of a response to the invitation to correct defects in a priority 
claim, the RO checks whether the indications furnished by the applicant 
have been received within the applicable time limit and whether they 
comply 
with 
the 
formal 
requirements 
of 
Rule 
4.10
(see 

GL/PCT-EPO A-VI, 1.1). If so, the RO follows the procedure laid down in 
GL/RO 170.

The RO notifies the applicant accordingly, using Form PCT/RO/111, and 
sends to the IB and the ISA, respectively, a copy of that notification as well 
as a copy of the corresponding sheet of the PCT request containing the 
corrections.

If the notice correcting the priority claim is received before the RO declares 
the priority claim void (see GL/PCT-EPO A-VI, 1.4.2) and not later than one 
month after the expiry of the time limit, the response is considered to have 
been received before the expiry of the applicable time limit.

1.4.2
Failure to correct

If, in response to the invitation to correct a priority claim, the applicant does 
not submit a notice correcting the priority claim before expiry of the 
applicable time limit (see GL/PCT-EPO A-VI, 1.4.1), that priority claim is, for 
the purposes of the PCT procedure, considered void and the RO so 
declares using Form PCT/RO/111. In addition to marking the PCT request 
in accordance with GL/RO 172, the RO also sends to the IB and the ISA, 
respectively, a copy of that declaration and a copy of the corresponding 
sheet of the request containing the marking.

1.5
Restoration of the right of priority

Where the international application has an international filing date which is 
later than, but within two months of, the date on which the priority period 
expired, the applicant may request restoration of the right of priority with the 
RO. This request may be made directly on the request form (Box No. VI) or 
separately (either upon receipt of the information from the RO using Form 
PCT/RO/110, Annex B (see GL/PCT-EPO A-VI, 1.4(ii)) or on the applicant's 
own initiative).

A request for restoration of the right of priority is admissible if:

(a)
the international filing date of the application is within the two-month 
period following the expiry of the priority period; where a priority claim 
in respect of the earlier application is not contained in the 
international application, the priority claim must be added (Rule 
26bis.1(a)) within the same time limit;

(b)
the request is submitted within the two-month period following the 
expiry of the priority period and is supplemented by a statement of 
reasons;

(c)
the fee for requesting restoration of the right of priority (see also 
GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 4.6) is paid within two months of the date on 
which the priority period expired; this time limit may not be extended 
before the EPO as RO.

Where the applicant makes a request for early publication under 
Art. 21(2)(b), the request for restoration and the statement of reasons or 
evidence (Rule 26bis.3(b)(iii)), or any notice under Rule 26bis.1(a) adding 
the priority claim, must be filed, and the pertinent fee be paid 
(Rule 26bis.3(d); GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 4.6), before the technical preparations 
for international publication have been completed (Rule 26bis.3(e)).

The EPO as RO grants a request for restoration of the right of priority only if 
the due care required by the circumstances has been taken ("due care" 
requirement). To satisfy this requirement, the applicant must show to the 
RO's satisfaction that the failure to file the international application within 
the priority period occurred in spite of due care required by the 
circumstances having been taken. The standard of having exercised "due 
care" can only be met if the applicant has taken all measures which a 
reasonably prudent applicant would have taken. The statement of reasons 
accompanying the request should describe in detail the facts and 
circumstances that have led to the late filing as well as any remedial or 
alternative steps taken to attempt on-time filing of the international 
application. Due care is considered to have been taken if non-compliance 
with the time limit results either from exceptional circumstances or from an 
isolated mistake within a normally satisfactory monitoring system.

The practice of the EPO as RO defines exceptional circumstances as ones 
that are unrelated to ordinary working procedures and arise either 
unexpectedly, as for example a sudden serious illness, or owing to some 
kind of upheaval, such as an internal reorganisation entailing a move.

March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part A – Chapter VI-5

Whether exceptional circumstances occurred depends on the facts of the 
case, and the standard to be met for this is very strict. In particular, events 
of force majeure may be regarded as exceptional circumstances. An event 
of force majeure means an external, unforeseeable and/or unavoidable 
circumstance beyond the control of the applicant or agent. Disasters, such 
as hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, international conflicts and 
war, may be considered such events. Due care is generally regarded as 
having been taken if it is demonstrated that the consequences of the event 
could not have been predicted and/or avoided.

The assessment of whether the failure to file the international application 
within the priority period resulted from an isolated mistake within a normally 
satisfactory monitoring system depends, among other things, on the size of 
the company of the applicant or agent. The same standard of care as is 
required of the patent department of a large firm cannot be expected of an 
individual or a small applicant. In addition, a different standard of due care 
is required depending on whether the mistake can be ascribed to an 
applicant, an agent in charge or an assistant.

The EPO as RO considers the facts and circumstances of each particular 
case, applying the principles summarised in GL/RO 166J-166M. The case 
law established by the EPO boards of appeal (developed with respect to 
the re-establishment of rights under Art. 122 EPC) is also taken into 
consideration when assessing whether due care has been exercised in the 
respective case. See also GL/EPO E-VIII, 3.2.

If the RO intends to refuse the request for restoration of the right of priority, 
as it finds that the statement of reasons is insufficient to determine whether 
the applicant has satisfied the due care criteria or that the due care criteria 
appear not to have been met, it invites the applicant to submit further 
evidence and/or observations on the intended refusal within a two-month 
time limit (Form PCT/RO/158). The RO explains in detail, in the Annex to 
Form PCT/RO/158, why it intends to refuse the request. After expiry of the 
two-month time limit, and taking into account the information available to it 
at this stage, the RO issues a decision to either restore the right of priority 
or refuse the request for restoration of the right of priority (Form 
PCT/RO/159).

The RO transmits a copy of all related documents received from the 
applicant to the IB (including a copy of the restoration request, the 
statement of reasons and any declaration or other evidence), except if it 
decides, either upon a reasoned request by the applicant or on its own 
motion, that (parts of) certain documents are not to be transmitted. In the 
latter case, the RO notifies the IB accordingly. If the RO receives a 
reasoned request from the applicant not to transmit (a part of) a document 
to the IB, but nevertheless decides to transmit that (part of a) document to 
the IB, it also notifies the applicant of this decision (relevant box in Form 
PCT/RO/159).

Part A – Chapter VI-6
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

The RO takes the decision not to transmit documents to the IB if it finds that 
a document or part thereof meets the requirements of Rule 26bis.3(h-bis), 
namely that:

(i)
a document or part thereof does not obviously serve the purpose of 
informing the public about the international application;

(ii)
publication or public access to any such document or part thereof 
would clearly prejudice the personal or economic interests of any 
person; and

(iii)
there is no prevailing public interest to have access to that document 
or part thereof.

A document or part thereof does not "obviously serve the purpose of 
informing the public about the international application" if it is clearly 
irrelevant for the disclosure or assessment of the international application 
as such. Making a document or a part thereof available to the public would 
"clearly prejudice the personal or economic interests of a person" if it would 
be harmful to that person's specific and concrete personal or economic 
interests. A merely abstract prejudice to hypothetical personal or economic 
interests is generally not sufficient.

A decision by the EPO as RO to restore the right of priority will be effective 
before the EPO as designated Office and, as a general rule, in all 
designated Offices, unless the respective designated Office has submitted 
a notification of incompatibility under Rule 49ter.1(g).

If no request for restoration of the right of priority has been filed by the 
applicant in the procedure before the EPO as RO or if the request for 
restoration has been rejected by the EPO as RO, the applicant may file a 
(new) request in the national phase, i.e. in the procedures before the EPO 
as designated Office and any other designated Office that has not made a 
reservation as to the applicability of Rule 49ter.1 and Rule 49ter.2. For the 
procedure before the EPO as designated Office, see GL/EPO E-VIII, 3.

1.6
Applicant's entitlement to claim priority

The applicant claiming the priority of an earlier application must be the 
applicant of the latter or the successor in title of the priority right. The 
question of whether the applicant is actually entitled to claim the priority of 
an earlier application is not examined during the international phase.

In proceedings before the EPO as designated or elected Office, the transfer 
of the priority right must be assessed under the EPC, regardless of any 
national laws. The EPC does not set out any formal requirements for the 
transfer of the priority right (see G 1/22 and G 2/22). For details on the 
procedure before the EPO as designated or elected Office, see 
GL/EPO A-III, 6.1.

Chapter VII – Languages

1.
Admissible languages on filing

1.1
General

The international application, i.e. the request, description, claim(s), 
drawing(s) and abstract, must be filed with the EPO as receiving Office in 
English, French or German.

An international application filed in another language will be transmitted to 
the IB to act as receiving Office instead of the EPO. This means that it is 
not possible to file an international application with the EPO as receiving 
Office in a language other than the three indicated in Art. 14 EPC for 
European patent applications not filed via the PCT route (Euro-direct 
applications).

1.2
International application filed in multiple languages

1.2.1
Abstract and text matter of the drawings

If the abstract and/or any text matter of the drawings is not filed in the same 
language as the description and claims, the applicant will be invited to 
correct the defect by the EPO as receiving Office (Form PCT/RO/106) 
within two months of the date of the invitation. If the applicant replies to the 
invitation within the prescribed time limit by submitting the translation in the 
language indicated in the invitation, the international filing date will remain 
unaffected.

1.2.2
Request

The request (including any declaration contained in the request under 
Rule 4.17) may be filed with the EPO as receiving Office in any official 
language of the EPO (e.g. the request filed in German and the rest of the 
application in English).

If the request is not filed in an official language of the EPO, the applicant 
will be invited to correct the defect (Form PCT/RO/106) within two months 
of the date of the invitation.

If the applicant replies to the invitation within the prescribed time limit by 
submitting the translation in one of the official languages of the EPO, the 
international filing date will remain unaffected.

1.2.3
Description and claims

1.2.3.1
Sentences or short fragments of the description and/or 

claims in a language other than the language of the proceedings
If the description and/or claims contain sentences or short fragments in a 
language other than the language of the proceedings, the applicant will be 
invited by the EPO as receiving Office (PCT/RO/108) to submit a request 
for rectification under Rule 91 to the EPO as International Searching 
Authority together with the translation of the relevant parts in the language 
of the application.

If the requirements under Rule 91 are fulfilled, the rectification will be 
authorised and will be considered effective from the international filing date. 
Otherwise, the respective sentences or fragments of the description and/or 
claims may not be further considered for the purpose of international 
search and/or preliminary examination.

This scenario only applies where a few words or sentences are in a 
language other than the language of the proceedings.

1.2.3.2
Technical or non-technical terms used in the description 

and/or the claims in a language other than the language of the 
proceedings
If the description and/or claims contain(s) technical or non-technical terms 
in a language other than the language of the proceedings, the EPO will 
assess whether the use of these terms is common or standard in the 
relevant technical field. In such a case, no translation will be required.

Otherwise, the applicant will be invited by the EPO as receiving Office to 
submit 
a 
request 
for 
rectification 
under 
Rule 91
(see 

GL/PCT-EPO A-VII, 1.2.3.1).

2.
Language of the proceedings

If an international application is filed with the receiving Office in one of the 
EPO official languages, that language will be the language of the 
proceedings before the EPO and may not be changed either during the 
international phase or on entry into the European phase (G 4/08).

If the international application is not filed with the receiving Office in one of 
the EPO official languages, the language of the proceedings before the 
EPO as International Authority will be the language of the translation 
furnished for the purposes of the search or, as the case may be, for the 
international preliminary examination. The following sections provide more 
detail on the requirement to file a translation.

2.1
Language for the purpose of the international search

For the purpose of the international search by the EPO as International 
Searching Authority, the international application must be in one of its three 
official languages, i.e. English, French or German. Where the international 
application is filed in a different language, the applicant must file a 
translation with the receiving Office into one of the EPO three official 
languages. This translation must be furnished within one month of the date 
of receipt of the international application by the receiving Office.

For international applications filed in Dutch see GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 2.2.

2.2
Language for the purpose of the supplementary international 

search
For the purpose of the supplementary international search by the EPO as 
Supplementary 
International 
Searching 
Authority, 
the 
international 

application must be in one of its three official languages, i.e. English, 
French or German. Where the international application is filed in a different 
language, and no translation into any of these languages has been filed for

the purpose of the proceedings before the International Searching Authority 
or for the purpose of international publication, a translation into one of these 
languages must be filed with the IB together with the request for 
supplementary international search.

2.3
Language for the purpose of the international preliminary 

examination
For the purpose of the international preliminary examination by the EPO as 
International Preliminary Examining Authority, the international application 
must be in one of its three official languages, i.e. English, French or 
German. If neither the language in which the international application was 
filed nor the language in which the application was published is one of the 
official languages of the EPO, the applicant must file a translation into one 
of these languages with the EPO as International Preliminary Examining 
Authority within the time limit for filing the demand.

3.
Derogations from the language of the proceedings in written 

proceedings

3.1
Written submissions

With the exception of amendments and corrections to the application, for 
which the language of the proceedings must be used, any other 
correspondence with the EPO can be in any of the EPO official languages.

The EPO as receiving Office will, however, reply in the language of the 
proceedings.

Chapter VIII – Common provisions

1.
Representation

1.1
General principles

The PCT explicitly allows the receiving Office to apply its national law to the 
extent that it requires applicants to be represented by an agent having the 
right to represent them before it. On this basis, the EPC provisions 
concerning professional representation apply in respect of international 
applications processed by the EPO as receiving Office.

An agent is required by the EPO acting as receiving Office if the applicant 
has neither a residence nor their principal place of business in an EPC 
contracting state. Such applicants must act through an agent in all 
proceedings before the EPO acting as receiving Office except for filing the 
application and paying fees.

In view of the importance of careful preparation of the international 
application and of its proper processing, it is in any case highly advisable 
for applicants to use the services of an agent.

An appointed agent who has the right to represent the applicant before the 
receiving Office is automatically also entitled to act before the International 
Bureau, the International Searching Authority, any Authority specified for 
supplementary search and the International Preliminary Examining
Authority ("agent for the international phase").

Information on the representation of the applicant in the international phase 
is to be indicated in Box No. IV of the PCT request form, in a separate 
power of attorney or via a separate notice referring to an existing general 
power of attorney, taking into account the instructions provided in the Notes 
to the PCT request form concerning Box No. IV and in GL/RO 117-121 as 
well as the information provided below.

1.2
Representation by an agent

Two categories of agent ("professional representative" in EPC terminology) 
have the right to practise before the EPO as receiving Office:

–
professional representatives or associations of representatives
entered in the directory of professional representatives maintained by 
the EPO;

–
legal practitioners qualified to act as a professional representative in 
patent matters in an EPC contracting state and having their place of 
business in that state.

Only a person belonging to at least one of these two categories may be 
appointed as an agent for an international application filed with the EPO as 
receiving Office.

If the agent is appointed using Box No. IV of the PCT request form, they
must be indicated there by name unless they belong to an association of

professional representatives registered as such with the EPO. They can 
indicate any address they wish as long as it is in an EPC contracting state.

If an association of professional representatives is appointed as agent
using Box No. IV of the PCT request form, the name of the association 
must be indicated there. The number under which the association is so 
registered with the EPO may also be indicated.

If an association of professional representatives is appointed, each member 
of the association may perform procedural acts on behalf of the applicant, 
and correspondence from the EPO is addressed to the association rather 
than one particular member.

Further agents may be appointed at any time to represent the applicant 
either in the international phase in general or specifically before the EPO 
acting as International Searching Authority, Supplementary International 
Searching Authority or International Preliminary Examining Authority. The 
appointment of a new agent for the international phase in general is treated 
as revocation of any earlier appointment of an agent, unless otherwise 
indicated in the power of attorney appointing the new agent. Furthermore, 
an agent appointed for the international phase in general, unless otherwise 
indicated in the document appointing them, may appoint sub-agents to 
represent the applicant.

1.3
Representation by a common agent, common representative or 

"deemed common representative"
If there are two or more applicants, each of them may choose to appoint 
their own agent, or they may choose to appoint a common agent for the 
international phase or one of the applicants who is entitled to file the 
international application to act as their common representative. The latter 
may in turn appoint an agent.

If the appointed common representative has neither a residence nor their 
principal place of business in an EPC contracting state, the EPO as 
receiving Office will require the appointment of an agent.

If a common agent or common representative is appointed using Box 
No. IV of the PCT request form, their name and address must be indicated 
there.

If no common agent or common representative is appointed, the applicant 
first named in the request who is entitled to file the international application 
with the EPO as receiving Office is considered to be the common 
representative. If such "deemed common representative" has neither a 
residence nor their principal place of business in an EPC contracting state, 
the EPO as receiving Office will require the appointment of an agent.

If no common agent is appointed, any correspondence is sent to the 
(deemed) common representative or, if the latter has appointed an agent, 
to their agent, unless a different address is provided as the address for 
correspondence.

A deemed common representative is not entitled to sign notices of 
withdrawal on behalf of co-applicants without submitting evidence of their 
consent to such withdrawal. If a deemed common representative has 
appointed an agent, the latter may validly perform any act which could be 
performed by the deemed common representative. If a co-applicant of the 
deemed common representative has appointed an agent, such agent will 
not be considered the "agent of record" and will be entitled to act only on 
behalf of that co-applicant.

1.4
Representation by an employee

Natural or legal persons having their residence or principal place of 
business in an EPC contracting state do not need to be represented by an 
agent in proceedings before the EPO acting as receiving Office, (S)ISA or 
IPEA. They may, however, act in these proceedings through an employee, 
who need not be an agent (GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.2) but who must be 
authorised (see GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13).

1.5
Manner of appointment of an agent, common agent or common 

representative
Appointment of an agent, common agent or common representative for the 
international phase requires a declaration to this effect. This can be made 
either in the PCT request form (Box No. IV) or in a separate notice ("power 
of attorney"). For this purpose the "PCT/Model of power of attorney" may 
be used, which is available on the WIPO website.

For the appointment of an agent, a common agent or a common 
representative to be effective, the PCT request or the power of attorney 
must be duly signed by (all) the applicant(s) for whom the agent, the 
common agent or the common representative is intended to act. However, 
a power of attorney must only be submitted to the EPO if the EPO's waiver 
of the requirement to submit a separate power of attorney does not apply in 
the circumstances. For further information on separate powers of attorney 
and the EPO's waiver
of the requirement to submit them, see 

GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.11 and 1.13.

Appointment of an agent or a common agent may also be effected by 
referring in the PCT request form (Box No. IX) or in a separate notice to an 
existing general power of attorney deposited with the EPO. A copy of the 
general power of attorney must only be furnished if the EPO's waiver 
concerning a copy of a general power of attorney does not apply in the 
circumstances. For further information on general powers of attorney and 
the EPO's waiver of the requirement to submit a copy of them, see 
GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.12-1.13.

A power of attorney may not be filed by fax or using the EPO Web-Form 
Filing service.

1.6
Address for correspondence

Where 
no 
agent 
or 
common 
representative 
is 
appointed, 
any 

correspondence is sent to the address, indicated in Box No. II or III of the 
PCT request form, of the applicant (if there is only one applicant) or of the 
deemed common representative (if there are two or more applicants).

However, if the applicant wishes correspondence to be sent to a different 
address, that address must be indicated in Box No. IV instead of the 
indication of an agent or common representative. In this case, and only in 
this case, the last check box of Box No. IV must be marked (that is, the last 
check box must not be marked if either of the check boxes "agent" or 
"common representative" in Box No. IV has been marked). For proceedings 
in the international phase before the EPO as receiving Office, International 
Searching Authority, Supplementary International Searching Authority or 
International 
Preliminary 
Examining 
Authority, 
the 
address 
for 

correspondence given may be that of any person in any country.

1.7
Representation before the EPO as International Searching 

Authority
Applicants may be represented before the EPO as International Searching 
Authority (ISA) by the agent appointed on filing the international application 
and/or having the right to practise before the receiving Office, who is
usually the agent for the international phase.

The agent appointed for the international phase – and thus including for 
proceedings before the ISA – may appoint a sub-agent to represent the 
applicant specifically before the EPO as ISA, provided that any person so 
appointed as sub-agent has the right to practise before the EPO acting as 
ISA. All communications issued by the ISA are then sent to the agent 
specifically appointed for proceedings before the EPO as ISA.

Applicants may also appoint an agent to represent them specifically before 
the EPO in its capacity as ISA. Any agent specifically appointed to act 
before the EPO as ISA must be entitled to practise before the EPO.

The applicant or agent for the international phase can appoint an agent 
specifically before the EPO as ISA by signing and submitting a separate 
power of attorney. Appointment may also be effected by reference in a 
separate notice to a duly deposited general power of attorney. In this case, 
the separate notice may be signed by the purported agent. The separate 
power of attorney or a copy of a general power of attorney must only be 
submitted to the EPO acting as ISA if the EPO's waiver of the requirement 
to submit it does not apply in the circumstances. For further information, 
see GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.11-1.13.

1.8
Representation before the EPO as Supplementary International 

Searching Authority
Applicants may be represented before the EPO as Supplementary 
International Searching Authority (SISA) by the agent appointed on filing 
the international application and/or having the right to practise before the 
receiving Office, who is usually the agent for the international phase.

The agent appointed for the international phase – and thus including for 
proceedings before the SISA – may appoint a sub-agent to represent the 
applicant specifically before the EPO as SISA, provided that any person so 
appointed as sub-agent has the right to practise before the EPO acting as 
SISA. All communications issued by the EPO as SISA are then sent to the 
agent specifically appointed for proceedings before the EPO as SISA.

PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part A – Chapter VIII-5

Applicants may also appoint an agent to represent them specifically before 
the EPO in its capacity as SISA. Any agent specifically appointed to act 
before the EPO as SISA must be entitled to practise before the EPO.

The applicant or agent for the international phase can appoint an agent 
specifically before the EPO as SISA by signing and submitting a separate 
power of attorney. Appointment may also be effected by reference in a 
separate notice to a duly deposited general power of attorney. In this case, 
the separate notice may be signed by the purported agent. The separate 
power of attorney or a copy of a general power of attorney must only be 
submitted to the EPO acting as SISA if the EPO's waiver of the requirement 
to submit it does not apply in the circumstances. For further information, 
see GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.11-1.13.

1.9
Representation before the EPO as International Preliminary 

Examining Authority
Applicants may be represented before the EPO as International Preliminary 
Examining Authority (IPEA)
by the agent appointed on filing the 

international application and/or having the right to practise before the 
receiving Office, who is usually the agent for the international phase.

The agent appointed for the international phase may appoint a sub-agent to 
represent the applicant specifically before the EPO as IPEA, provided that 
any person so appointed as sub-agent has the right to practise before the 
EPO acting as IPEA.

Applicants may also appoint an agent to represent them specifically before 
the EPO as IPEA. Any agent specifically appointed before the EPO as 
IPEA must be entitled to practise before the EPO.

The applicant or agent for the international phase can appoint an agent 
specifically before the EPO as IPEA either by completing Box No. III of the 
demand form (PCT/IPEA/401) and signing the demand, or by signing and 
submitting a separate power of attorney. Appointment may also be effected 
by reference in the PCT demand or in a separate notice to a duly deposited 
general power of attorney. In this case, the PCT demand or the separate 
notice may be signed by the purported agent. The separate power of 
attorney or a copy of a general power of attorney must only be submitted to
the EPO acting as IPEA if the EPO's waiver of the requirement to submit it 
does not apply in the circumstances. For further information, see 
GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.11-1.13.

1.10 Representation before the EPO as designated or elected Office
A (common) agent appointed in the PCT request as agent for an 
international application is appointed only for the international phase. This 
means that a professional representative authorised to act before the EPO 
and who acted for the applicant(s) in the international phase is not 
automatically considered to be the representative for the European phase. 
However, if the EPO is the receiving Office and the agent is appointed by a 
separate authorisation, the applicant(s) may, at the same time, indicate in 
that authorisation that the agent is also appointed to represent the 
applicant(s) before the EPO as designated or elected Office in the 

Art. 49

10.023

March 2024

European phase. To designate an agent for the international and European 
phases
at 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
applicant 
may 
use 

Form EPA/EPO/OEB 1003, which is available on the EPO website.

If an agent is appointed by reference to an existing general power of 
attorney, the appointment of the agent for the European phase too must be 
explicitly stated in the separate notice.

1.11 Power of attorney
Generally, a separate power of attorney must be submitted to either the 
receiving Office or the International Bureau or, where it appoints an agent 
to represent an applicant specifically before the ISA, SISA or IPEA, to that
Authority.

It must be duly signed and the name and address of the appointed person 
must comply with Rule 4.4.

However, the EPO in its capacity as receiving Office, ISA, SISA and IPEA 
has waived the requirement under Rule 90.4(b) that a separate power of 
attorney be submitted to appoint a (common) agent or a common 
representative (see GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.13). Thus, in cases where this
waiver is applicable, the requirements of signature and proper indication of 
name and address under Rule 90.4(c) do not apply.

1.12 General power of attorney
A "general power of attorney" is a separate power of attorney appointing an 
agent to represent an applicant in relation to any international application 
which they may file. Generally, for such appointment to be effective:

–
reference must be made in the PCT request, the PCT demand or a 
separate notice to the general power of attorney;

–
the general power of attorney must be deposited with the receiving 
Office or, in the case of appointment specifically before the ISA, SISA 
or IPEA, with that Authority;

–
a copy of the general power of attorney must be attached to the PCT 
request, the PCT demand or the separate notice, as the case may 
be.

However, the EPO in its capacity as receiving Office, ISA, SISA and IPEA 
has waived the requirement under Rule 90.5(a)(ii) that a copy of a general 
power of attorney be attached to the PCT request, the PCT demand or a 
separate notice (see GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.13).

1.13 Waivers – exceptions to applicability
The waivers by the EPO with regard to the requirements under 
Rule 90.4(b) and Rule 90.5(a)(ii) do not apply to legal practitioners referred 
to in Art. 134(8) EPC or to employees referred to in Art. 133(3) EPC if they 
are not also professional representatives.

March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part A – Chapter VIII-7

The waiver by the EPO with regard to the requirement under Rule 90.4(b)
that a separate power of attorney be submitted to appoint a (common) 
agent or a common representative does not apply if the (common) agent or 
the common representative submits any notice of withdrawal referred to in 
Rules 90bis.1 to 90bis.4.

The waiver by the EPO with regard to the requirement under 
Rule 90.5(a)(ii) that a copy of the general power of attorney be attached to 
the PCT request, the PCT demand or the separate notice does not apply if 
the (common) agent submits any notice of withdrawal referred to in 
Rules 90bis.1 to 90bis.4.

Furthermore, the EPO acting as receiving Office, ISA, SISA or IPEA may 
require the filing of a separate power of attorney or a copy of a general 
power of attorney if necessary in the circumstances of a particular case, for 
example if:

–
a procedural act is performed by a purported agent who is not the 
agent of record, unless the purported agent belongs to the same 
office as the agent of record, or both the purported agent and the 
agent of record are employees of the applicant or, if there is more 
than one applicant, of the common representative;

–
there is doubt as to whether the agent or common representative is 
entitled to act.

2.
Form of documents

2.1
Documents making up the international application

The physical requirements of the documents making up the international 
application, i.e. request, description, claims, drawings and abstract, are set 
out in Rule 11. Compliance with these requirements, which is checked by 
the receiving Office, is only required to the extent necessary for the 
purpose of reasonably uniform international publication.

See GL/RO 132-146.

2.2
Later documents

The requirements of Rules 10 and 11.1 to 11.13 also apply to any other 
document (e.g. replacement sheets, amended claims, translations) 
submitted after the filing of the international application.

2.3
Number of copies

The documents constituting an international application must be filed with 
the EPO as receiving Office in one copy only. The same applies to any of 
the documents referred to in the check list of the PCT request form 
(Box No. IX).

However, if the application is filed by fax a confirmation copy must be filed 
by post at the same time. See GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 1.2.2. As to subsequent 
documents filed by fax, there is no obligation to file a confirmation copy

unless the receiving Office invites the applicant to submit one. 
See GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 1.3.

2.4
Filing of subsequent documents

See GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 1.3.

3.
Signature of documents

3.1
Documents filed after filing the international application

Any paper submitted by the applicant in the course of the international 
procedure, other than the international application itself, must, if not itself in 
the form of a letter, be accompanied by a letter identifying the international 
application to which it relates. All letters must be signed by the applicant or 
by a duly appointed agent or common representative. A deemed common 
representative is entitled to sign on behalf of the co-applicants with the only 
exception of notices of withdrawal.

A demand for international preliminary examination must be signed by the 
applicant or, if there is more than one applicant, by all applicants. If the 
signature of one or more applicants is missing, the EPO as IPEA will not 
invite the applicant(s) to furnish the missing signature(s) provided that at 
least one of the applicants has signed the demand. It is also possible for 
(common) agents or common representatives to sign a demand on behalf 
of the applicant(s) who appointed them. Where the demand is signed by a 
(common) agent the EPO as IPEA will not invite the applicant(s) to file a 
(separate) power of attorney or a copy of a general power of attorney since 
the EPO has waived these requirements. A deemed common 
representative is entitled to sign on behalf of the co-applicants with the only 
exception of notice of withdrawal.

3.2
Signature of the PCT request and a power of attorney

For the requirements concerning the signature of the PCT request and a 
power of attorney see GL/RO 122-128.

The EPO as RO, ISA, SISA and IPEA has waived the requirement that, for 
the effective appointment of an agent, common agent or common 
representative, a signed separate power of attorney must be submitted to it 
if the PCT request is not signed by (all) the applicant(s). The EPO has also 
waived the requirement that a copy of the general power of attorney be 
attached to the PCT request or to a separate notice if appointment of a 
(common) agent is made by reference to a general power of attorney. For 
further details on powers of attorney, general powers of attorney and the 
waivers see GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.11-1.13.

Chapter II – General

1.
International search and written opinion under Chapter I

The procedure through which a PCT application proceeds from the filing of 
the application to the conclusion of the international phase comprises the 
international search and written opinion under Chapter I, which is 
mandatory for applicants, and the international preliminary examination 
under Chapter II, which is optional.

The objective of the international search is to discover the prior art which is 
relevant for the purpose of determining whether, and if so to what extent, 
the claimed invention to which the international application relates is or is 
not novel and does or does not involve an inventive step. The result of the 
search is communicated to the applicant in the form of an international 
search report. In some cases the International Searching Authority is not 
required to establish a search for some or all of the claimed subject-matter, 
e.g. because more than one invention is claimed or the application covers 
excluded subject-matter.

In its capacity as an International Searching Authority, the EPO is 
empowered not only to carry out the international search but also to 
formulate a preliminary and non-binding opinion on whether the claimed 
invention appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step and to be 
industrially applicable When appropriate, an opinion will also be given on 
added subject-matter, unity, insufficient disclosure and clarity or support 
issues, as well as formal defects.

This opinion is sent to the applicant in the form of a written opinion of the 
International Searching Authority (WO-ISA) together with the search report. 
If no international preliminary examination report is to be established 
because the applicant did not file a demand for preliminary examination, or 
the demand has been withdrawn, the International Bureau will prepare a 
report, entitled "international preliminary report on patentability (Chapter I of 
the Patent Cooperation Treaty)" having the same contents as the written 
opinion. Even if the applicant filed any amendments under Article 19, the 
amendments will not be taken into consideration in the international 
preliminary report on patentability (PCT Chapter I).

The written opinion (and any informal comments filed by the applicant) will 
be made available to the public by the International Bureau at the same 
time as the international publication.

The EPO is an International Searching and Preliminary Examining Authority 
for the vast majority of PCT contracting states. All applications are treated 
in the same manner irrespective of their country of origin.

Although the PCT procedure differs in some procedural and formal aspects 
from the European procedure, the criteria for search and examination with 
respect to novelty, inventive step, industrial applicability, unity, non-
patentable subject-matter or exclusions, insufficient disclosure and clarity 
are in principle the same. This means that search and examination under 
the PCT is carried out in the same way and applying the same quality

standard as for a European application in so far as the same requirements 
are examined.

There is no difference between an international and a European search, 
either in respect of the method and thoroughness of the search or in 
respect of the sources of prior art searched.

2.
Objective of the search

The objective of the international search is to discover the prior art which is 
relevant for the purpose of determining novelty and inventive step. The 
international search as such, thus, does not differ from a European search.

3.
Search documentation

Section B-II, 3 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies mutatis 
mutandis.

4.
Search report

An international search report is prepared containing the results of the 
search, in particular by identifying the documents constituting the relevant 
state of the art (see GL/PCT-EPO B-X, 9).

The search report is accompanied by a written opinion of the International 
Searching Authority (see GL/PCT-EPO B-XI).

5.
Time limit

The time limit for establishing the international search report and the 
WO-ISA is three months from the receipt of the search copy by the ISA or 
nine months from the priority date, whichever occurs later. In practice this 
means that the search and the written opinion should be established no 
later than 16 months from the priority date.

6.
Representation before the EPO as ISA or SISA

Any agent or other person entitled to undertake representation before the 
receiving Office with which the international application was filed may 
represent the applicant throughout the international phase, including before 
the EPO as ISA or SISA (see GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.1). Depending on 
which office acted as receiving Office, such agent or other person may or 
may not be a professional representative or legal practitioner entitled to 
undertake representation under Art. 134 EPC.

Representation before the EPO as ISA or SISA may also be undertaken by 
any agent (professional representative or legal practitioner) competent to 
act 
before 
the 
EPO 
and 
duly 
appointed 
for 
this 
purpose 

(see GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.7 and 1.8).

Chapter III – Characteristics of the search

1.
Scope of the search

1.1
Completeness of the search

The scope of the international search is defined in Art. 15(4), stipulating 
that the International Searching Authority must endeavour to discover as 
much of the relevant prior art as its facilities permit and must, in any case, 
consult the documentation specified in the PCT Regulations (Rule 34). It 
follows from this definition ("as its facilities permit") that the scope of an 
international search is equivalent to that of a European search. 
International and European searches are thus fully identical in scope.

See also ISPE Guidelines 15.18 and 15.20.

1.2
Effectiveness and efficiency of the search

Section B-III, 2.2 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

1.3
Search in analogous fields

Section B-III, 2.3 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

1.4
Search on the internet

Section B-III, 2.4 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

Concerning the dating of internet citations, see GL/PCT-EPO G-IV, 6.4.

2.
The subject of the search

2.1
Basis for the search

The international search is carried out on the basis of the search copy of 
the 
application 
as 
transmitted 
to 
the 
ISA 
by 
the 
RO 
(see 

GL/PCT-EPO B-III, 2.3.1).

Concerning rectification of obvious mistakes and/or incorporation by 
reference 
of 
missing 
or 
correct 
parts 
or 
elements, 
see 

GL/PCT-EPO B-III, 2.3 and H-II, 2.2.2.

2.2
Interpretation of claims

Section B-III, 3.2 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

2.2.1
Claims with explicit references to the description or drawings

Although explicit references in the claims to features elucidated in the 
description or in the drawings are only permissible where "absolutely 
necessary", if claims contain such references, the examiner should strive to 
search these technical features as long as they are unambiguously defined 
by specific parts of the description.

Art. 15(4)
Rule 34

GL/ISPE 15.46-15.47

Part B – Chapter III-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

However, 
where 
the 
reference 
does 
not 
clearly 
identify 
which 

subject-matter of the description and/or drawings is to be considered as 
included in the claim, the examiner may informally contact the applicant for 
clarification before the search is carried out (see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.3). 
In the special case of "omnibus claims" (e.g. a claim reading "The invention 
substantially as herein described"), no request for informal clarification 
should be issued, and subsequently the search report will be designated as 
complete.

The procedure above should be followed regardless of whether or not the 
reference to the drawings and/or the description is allowable according to 
Rule 6.2(a).

Where the reference does not appear to be justified, the examiner should 
raise an objection in the written opinion.

2.3
Obvious mistakes and missing or correct parts/elements

2.3.1
General considerations

Since there is no right to amend the application until after the international 
search has been established, the international search must be carried out 
on the basis of the search copy of the application as transmitted to the EPO 
as ISA by the RO, except that obvious mistakes or formal matters which 
are contrary to the PCT and are called to the applicant's attention by the 
RO may be corrected (see also GL/PCT-EPO H-IV).

2.3.2
Request for rectification of obvious mistakes (Rule 91)

An applicant can request authorisation to rectify obvious mistakes in the 
international application (see GL/PCT-EPO H-IV, 2). The examiner (if the 
request relates to the description, claims or drawings) will have to assess 
whether such a request can be authorised according to the criteria set out 
in Rule 91 – see GL/ISPE 8.07-8.08. If RO has erroneously authorised 
such rectification, this may affect the search (see GL/PCT-EPO H-IV, 2.1).

If the changes requested by the applicant before the receipt of the ISR are 
not rectifications, but rather amendments, the examiner must refuse them, 
because there is no right to amend the application until after the 
international search report has been established. This applies even if the 
applicant refers to them as rectifications and even if they would be 
allowable amendments not adding subject-matter to the application as 
originally filed. For example, reformulation of claims, deletion of technical 
terms, deletion or limitation of claims and the taking of subject-matter from 
the description into the claims must all be refused at this stage regardless 
of whether or not they might be allowable, since they are not rectifications, 
but rather substantive amendments.

2.3.3
Incorporating missing parts or elements, or correct parts or 

elements, completely contained in the priority document
If applicants omit to file part(s) of the application and/or (an) entire 
element(s) thereof (i.e. all of the description and/or all of the claims), they 
may still furnish it (them) at a later date without affecting the international 
filing date, subject to the requirements of Rule 4.18 and Rule 20.6(a) and 

Art. 19
Rule 91.1
GL/ISPE 15.10, 15.23

Rule 91

Art. 19
GL/ISPE 15.10

Rule 20.5


March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part B – Chapter III-3

provided the missing part(s) and/or element(s) were completely contained 
in the priority document.

Similarly if applicants appear to have erroneously filed part(s) of the 
application and/or (an) entire element(s) thereof (i.e. all of the description 
and/or all of the claims), they may still furnish the correct part(s) and/or 
element(s) at a later date without affecting the international filing date, 
subject to the requirements of Rules 4.18 and 20.6(a) and provided the 
correct part(s) and/or element(s) were completely contained in the priority 
document (see GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 6).

The activity of the EPO as ISA depends on the decisions taken by the RO 
with regard to the international application and its filing date; see also 
GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 6. 
Therefore, 
in 
cases 
where 
the 
international 

application was corrected by the RO under Rule 20.5bis, the EPO as ISA 
will carry out the search on the basis of the international application 
including the correct element(s) and/or part(s) if:

(a)
the RO notifies it of the correct element(s) and/or part(s) before the 
start of the search; or

(b)
the RO notifies it of the correct element(s) and/or part(s) after the 
start of the search (including after its completion) and the applicant 
pays an additional fee equal to the search fee within one month of 
the date of the invitation to do so issued by the EPO (Rule 40bis.1
and Article 2(1) RFees) (see GL/PCT-EPO B-III, 2.3.4).

The examiner checks whether the RO's assessment of the "completely 
contained" criterion was correct (see GL/PCT-EPO H-II, 2.2.2). If the RO 
erroneously considered that the missing part(s) and/or element(s), or 
correct part(s) and/or element(s), were completely contained in the priority 
document, the search should be extended to include documents which 
would be relevant if the application were to be redated (such documents 
can be cited as "L" in the ISR).

See also GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 2.1.

2.3.4
Correct elements or parts notified after the start of the search 

and additional fee
The RO may notify the ISA of correct part(s) and/or element(s) after the ISA 
has begun to draw up the international search report. In such cases, the 
EPO as ISA will invite the applicant to pay an additional fee equal to the 
search fee within one month of the date of the invitation (Form 208) 
(Rule 40bis.1 and Article 2(1) RFees).

If the EPO as ISA is notified of correct element(s) and/or part(s) after the 
search has started but before its completion and the additional fee is paid, 
the EPO will also complete the already initiated search and issue a 
non-official international search report and written opinion based on the 
international application as initially submitted. However, the non-official 
international search report and written opinion are issued only for the 
benefit of the applicant and any designated Offices which have given notice 

Rule 20.5bis

OJ EPO 2020, A81


Part B – Chapter III-4

under Rule 20.8(b-bis)
of an incompatibility. They therefore do not 

constitute the international search report under Rule 43 and written opinion 
under Rule 43bis. The applicant thus has no obligation to respond to the 
non-official written opinion upon entry into the European phase.

Regarding the treatment in the European phase of correct element(s) or 
part(s) notified after the ISA has begun to draw up the international search 
report, please see Section C-III, 1.3 in the Guidelines for Examination in the 
EPO.

mutatis mutandis.

2.9
Different categories

Section B-III, 3.10 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

2.10 Subject-matter excluded from search
The examiner may exclude certain subject-matter from the search. These 
exclusions may result from the international application
including 

subject-matter which the EPO as ISA is not required to deal with (see 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 2). They may also arise because the description, 
claims or drawings fail to meet a requirement, such as clarity or support of 
the claims by the description, to such an extent that no meaningful search 
can 
be 
carried 
out 
for 
all 
or 
some 
of 
the 
claims 
(see 

GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3).

2.11 Nucleotide and amino acid sequences
If, after an invitation from the EPO as ISA according to Rule 13ter.1, the 
applicant has not submitted the sequence listing in the required format (in 
XML and complying with WIPO Standard ST.26) and in an accepted 
language and paid the late furnishing fee within the time limit set, the EPO 
as ISA will carry out the international search without the sequence listing to 
the extent that a meaningful search can be carried out (see also 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.2).

If, in addition to an ST.26-compliant sequence listing, another sequence 
listing is also filed in another format accepted for the filing of documents, 
only the sequence listing complying with ST.26 will be taken into account 
when searching the application.

2.12 Lack of unity
When the claims of the international application do not relate to one 
invention only, or to a group of inventions so linked as to form a single 
general inventive concept, the applicant will normally be invited to pay 
additional search fees. If the applicant does not pay any additional search 
fees in response to the invitation, the international search will normally be 
restricted to those parts that relate to the invention, or so linked group of 
inventions, first mentioned in the claims. If additional fees have been paid 
within the prescribed time limit, those parts that relate to the inventions 
covered thereby are also searched. See also GL/PCT-EPO B-VII.

Part B – Chapter IV-1

Chapter IV – Search procedure and strategy

1.
Analysis of the application prior to searching

1.1
Taking into account results of an earlier search and 

classification
Applicants may request the ISA to take any earlier searches into account, 
including searches not carried out by the EPO.

It may happen that the PCT application to be searched by the EPO as ISA 
is a "doublure" of a previous application. A later filed application is 
considered as a doublure when (i) the search report for the first application 
is issued by the EPO, (ii) the earlier application is claimed as priority, (iii)
this priority claim is valid, and (iv) the later search report can at least partly 
be based on a search report of the earlier application.

Where the EPO can base the ISR on an earlier search that it has 
performed on an application whose priority is validly claimed for the 
international application, the international search fee paid will be refunded 
in part or in full depending upon the extent to which the EPO benefits from 
that earlier search. No refund is made if priority has not been validly 
claimed (see also GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 9.2).

A request to take into account an earlier search not made by the EPO has 
no impact on the work of the examiner, who will do an independent full-
scope international search. However, the documents cited in the earlier 
search report (which will be available in the file) might be useful. No refund 
is made for an earlier search that was not carried out by the EPO itself.

For international applications filed on or after 1 July 2017, in carrying out 
the international search, the EPO as ISA may take earlier search results 
into account where the applicant makes a request to that effect under 
Rule 4.12 as well as in the cases envisaged under Rule 41.2. This means 
that the EPO as ISA will also be able to take earlier search and 
classification results into account where the international application claims 
the priority of one or more earlier applications in respect of which an earlier 
search has been carried out by the EPO, or where the RO has transmitted 
to the EPO as ISA a copy of the results of any earlier search or of any 
earlier classification under Rule 23bis.2(a) or (b), or where such a copy is 
available to the EPO as ISA in a form and manner acceptable to it.

1.2
PCT Direct applications

Under PCT Direct, an applicant filing an international application claiming 
priority from an earlier national, European or international application 
already 
searched 
by 
the 
EPO 
(i.e. 
a 
"doublure"; 
see 

GL/PCT-EPO B-IV, 1.1) is able to react to any objections raised in the 
search opinion drawn up for the priority application. This simplifies the 
assessment of the international application and adds to the value of the 
international search report and written opinion established by the EPO.

Part B – Chapter IV-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

1.2.1
Requests for PCT Direct

Applicants may request to have their international application processed 
under PCT Direct by filing a letter ("PCT Direct letter") containing informal 
comments aimed at overcoming objections raised in the search opinion 
established by the EPO for the priority application. Such informal comments 
are to be understood as arguments regarding the patentability of the claims 
of the international application and also possibly as explanations regarding 
any modifications to the application documents, in particular to the claims, 
in comparison with the earlier application. PCT Direct letters do not form 
part of the international application.

Upon receipt of a PCT Direct letter, the international application will be 
processed under PCT Direct only where the following two requirements are 
met:

(a)
the informal comments are filed together with the international 
application with the receiving Office in the form specified in 
GL/PCT-EPO A-IV, 1.2, and

(b)
the international application claims priority of an earlier application 
searched by the EPO (European, national or international first filing).

1.2.2
Processing of PCT Direct letters

PCT Direct letters filed with the receiving Office will be transmitted to the 
EPO as International Searching Authority and to the International Bureau of 
WIPO together with the search copy and record copy, respectively.

At the EPO as International Searching Authority, the examiner performing 
the international search will take informal comments filed under PCT Direct 
into account when preparing the international search report and written 
opinion, provided that they meet the requirements (a) and (b) listed in 
GL/PCT-EPO B-IV, 1.2.1 and that they are in the form specified in 
GL/PCT-EPO A-IV, 1.2.

The written opinion will reflect this by acknowledging the PCT Direct letter 
and addressing its content insofar as it is relevant to the international 
search procedure. The examiner, however, may make explicit reference to 
the earlier search opinion only if it is annexed to the PCT Direct letter.

In accordance with the PCT provisions on file inspection, PCT Direct letters 
will be available to the public on WIPO's PATENTSCOPE.

1.3
Third-party observations

For general information on third-party observations in the PCT phase, see 
GL/PCT-EPO E-II.

If the formalities officer forwards third-party observations to the examiner 
before a final report (ISR, SISR or IPER) is established, the examiner 
should consider them in the same way as in the European procedure (see 
GL/EPO E-VI, 3). However, given that under the PCT third-party 
observations should refer to novelty or inventive step only, their relevance 
will in most cases depend on the relevance of the prior-art documents in 

PCT AI Part 8


March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part B – Chapter IV-3

support of them. Any document(s) provided to the examiner with the 
observations will either have been received from the IB or obtained by the 
formalities officer.

Third-party observations will normally not reach the examiner at the 
international search stage if the ISR is established and received by the IB 
on time, namely before publication of the application. However, this may 
happen when the international search is performed after an A2 publication.

If the third-party observations are relevant, the documents will be cited in 
the ISR and in section V of the WO-ISA. The examiner will take the third-
party observations and the applicant's comments, if present, into account 
when drafting the WO-ISA.

If the third-party observations are not relevant or not sufficiently 
understandable, the documents will not be included in the ISR. The 
examiner will insert a comment in section V of the WO-ISA indicating that 
the third-party observations have been taken into account and found not to 
be relevant or that the third-party observations could not be taken into 
account, together with the reasons.

Procedure after searching

3.1
Preparation of the search report

Section B-IV, 3.1 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

An information sheet regarding the search strategy is systematically 
annexed to all international search reports, including partial search reports. 
If the application lacks unity of invention, the data contained in this sheet 
will only concern the invention(s) for which the search fee(s) has (have) 
been paid. The information sheet will contain certain details about the 
databases in which the examiner conducted the prior-art search, the 
classification symbols defining the extent of the search, and the keywords 
selected by the examiner or any other element relating to the invention to 
be searched and used to retrieve the relevant prior art. Upon publication of 
the international search report, the information sheet will be made available 
to the public via file inspection on WIPO's PATENTSCOPE and in the 
European Patent Register.

3.2
Amended international search report

It might happen that there was an error in the international search report 
and the applicant requests correction of that error. In such a case the 
examiner should consider issuing a corrected ISR (and possibly WO-ISA).

Further reasons for amending the international search report are indicated 
in ISPE Guidelines 15.74.

Chapter VI – The state of the art at the search 
stage

1.
General

The general considerations relating to the state of the art with regard to the 
determination 
of 
novelty 
and 
inventive 
step 
are 
set 
out 
in 

GL/PCT-EPO G-IV.

2.
State of the art – oral disclosure, etc.

According to Rule 33.1(a) and Rule 33.1(b), oral disclosure, use, exhibition, 
etc. are recognised as prior art only when this is substantiated by a written 
disclosure, contrary to Art. 54 EPC.

See also ISPE Guidelines 11.22 and 15.05.

Where a non-written disclosure occurs and both the non-written disclosure 
and the written account of it are published before the relevant date as 
defined in Rule 64.1(b), the examiner will cite the written account in the 
search report and give the date of the written disclosure on the search 
report. In this case, the written disclosure constitutes the prior art.

If the written disclosure was made available to the public on or after the 
filing date of the international application concerned, the written disclosure 
will be cited in the international search report together with the date on 
which it was available, provided that the non-written disclosure was made 
available to the public prior to the filing date of the international application. 
The written opinion and the international preliminary examination report will 
draw attention to the non-written disclosure in Box No. VI (Certain 
documents cited).

Where a non-written disclosure occurs but is not followed by any written 
account, it is not cited in the international search report, because it is not 
considered to be state of the art under the PCT. The examiner makes a 
note of this non-written disclosure and will reconsider its status if the 
application enters the European phase before the EPO (see GL/EPO 
B-VI, 2).

3.
Priority

Section B-VI, 3 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

4.
Conflicting applications

4.1
Potentially conflicting European and international applications

Generally, where the international search is concluded less than eighteen 
months after the international filing date of the application, it will not be 
possible at the time of the search to make a complete search for potentially 
conflicting European and international applications. This search therefore 
has to be completed during the mandatory top-up search if a demand under 
Chapter II PCT has been made (see GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 5) or alternatively

Part B – Chapter VII-1

Chapter VII – Unity of invention

1.
General remarks

Unity is assessed in the same way in the PCT and European procedures. 
However, the consequences of a finding of lack of unity at the search 
and/or examination stages are different under the PCT, as are the actions 
to be taken by the examiner. In particular, the applicant may be asked to 
pay additional search and/or examination fees and may do so under 
protest.

Furthermore, divisional applications are not allowed under the PCT.

2.
Lack of unity at the search stage

If the lack of unity finding is raised at the search stage, a search is 
conducted for the invention first mentioned in the claims and the applicant 
is invited to pay additional search fees with Form PCT/ISA/206 (hereafter 
referred to as "Form 206"). The applicant can then decide to:

(i)
not pay any additional fees,

(ii)
pay some or all fees without protest or

(iii)
pay some or all fees under protest.

At the same time as completing Form 206, the examiner completes the 
provisional opinion accompanying the partial search results (EPO Form 
1707) for the searched first invention. Form 206 and EPO Form 1707 are 
sent together to the applicant. The examiner must give a complete and self-
contained reasoning for the lack of unity in EPO Form 1707.

In the case of a doublure (see GL/PCT-EPO B-IV, 1.1) where the earlier 
application also lacked unity, the applicant should be invited to pay 
additional fees even if all inventions were searched in the earlier 
application. The amount refunded will then be decided for each invention 
separately.

3.
No request for payment of additional search fees

Exceptionally it might be chosen not to request the applicant to pay 
additional search fees, even if an objection as to lack of unity occurs. This 
could be the case when the additional search effort for the other 
invention(s) is minor. In addition, no invitation to pay additional search fees 
should be issued when the other inventions are either not novel or do not 
possess an inventive step over the prior art at hand. However, it must be 
borne in mind that the written opinion under Chapter I must be written for all 
inventions that were searched, including those for which no additional 
search fees were requested. If additional search fees are not requested, for 
consistency reasons the examiner should not ask for additional 
examination fees
should 
a 
demand for international 
preliminary 

examination under Chapter II be filed (see GL/PCT-EPO C-V, 3.3). Thus, 
when deciding on whether to ask for additional search fees, the 
examination effort for the whole procedure must also be taken into account.

Art. 17(3)(a)
Rule 13, 40.1
GL/ISPE 10

OJ EPO 2017, A20


Part B – Chapter VII-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

If an objection of lack of unity has been raised but it was exceptionally 
chosen not to request the applicant to pay additional search fees, the ISR is 
issued for all inventions, indicating that the application lacks unity and 
listing the different groups of inventions. The WO-ISA is completed for all 
searched inventions. In Section IV of the WO-ISA, the examiner indicates 
that the requirement of unity is not fulfilled and that all claims have been 
searched and examined and provides full reasons on the separate sheet.

4.
Cascading non-unity

If additional search fees are paid in response to an invitation to do so and 
the additional search(es) reveal(s) a further lack of unity "a posteriori", no 
further invitation to pay further additional search fees is issued.

If the applicant pays (an) additional search fee(s), a search is carried out for 
the invention(s) for which the search fee(s) has/have been paid.

If the search reveals that one or more of these inventions also lack unity "a 
posteriori", only the first invention of each of the groups of inventions is 
searched.

The WO-ISA will be drafted for all the searched inventions. Section III must 
be modified to cover the inventions actually searched. Under Section IV, full 
reasons must be given for all the non-unity objections raised. Under 
Section V an opinion as to novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability 
must be given for all searched inventions.

Claims not searched during the international phase can be prosecuted 
during the regional phase before the EPO in accordance with GL/EPO 
F-V, 7.1, as appropriate.

Example

A lack of unity objection is raised by the EPO acting as ISA, identifying four 
different inventions A, B, C and D. The first invention A is searched and the 
applicant is invited to pay further search fees for inventions B, C and D.

The applicant pays two further search fees for inventions B and C. During 
the additional search, B is found to lack unity "a posteriori" and is divided 
into the groups of inventions B1, B2 and B3.

In this case only B1 and C are searched, so in Section III of the WO-ISA 
the claims relating to inventions B2, B3 and D are indicated as not 
searched. In Section IV, full reasons must be given for why the claims of 
the application were divided into A, B, C and D and why B was further 
subdivided into B1, B2 and B3. Under Section V an opinion on patentability 
must be given for A, B1 and C.

Examination of the application in the European phase will be based on 
either A, B1 or C (see GL/EPO F-V, 7.1(iii)). For the claims relating to 
inventions B2, B3 and D, an invitation under Rule 164(2) EPC will be 
issued in accordance with GL/EPO F-V, 7.1(iv).

The provisions of section B-VII, 1.3 in the Guidelines for Examination in the

6.
Reply from the applicant to the invitation to pay additional search 

fees

6.1
No payment of additional search fees

If, after an invitation to pay additional search fees, the applicant does not do 
so, the file will not be returned to the examiner, but the final search report 
and the WO-ISA, which were already prepared by the examiner at the initial 
search stage, will be sent out by the formalities officer.

During the European phase, the applicant may still pursue claimed 
inventions which were not searched in the international phase upon 
invitation 
to 
pay 
search 
fees 
by 
the 
examining 
division. 

See GL/EPO C-III, 3.2.

6.2
Payment of additional search fees without protest

If, after an invitation to pay additional search fees, the applicant has paid 
additional search fees without protest, a complete search will be carried out 
for the inventions for which search fees have been paid and the ISR will be 
issued for these inventions. The WO-ISA will be drafted for the claims for 
which search fees have been paid. Section IV is to be filled out, and 
Section III must be modified to the actual payment of fees.

6.3
Payment of additional search fees under protest

In reply to Form 206, applicants may pay some or all of the additional fees 
under protest. If they do so, then this triggers the protest procedure for 
determining whether the request for payment of the additional fees was 
justified (see also GL/PCT-EPO B-VII, 7).

If the applicant has paid additional search fees under protest and the 
Review Panel decided that the protest was fully or partly justified, the 
examiner will follow the decision of the Review Panel and will proceed to 
establish the ISR and WO-ISA for the inventions for which search fees 
have been paid. In the ISR the examiner will adapt the number of 
inventions and their definitions as well as the non-unity reasoning to be 
consistent with the decision of the review panel. In the WO-ISA, Section IV 
and the reasoning will be adapted to the decision of the Review Panel and 
Section III will be modified to the actual payment of fees. Under Section V 
an opinion as to novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability for all 
searched inventions will be given.

In the special situation where the protest was fully justified and where, as a 
consequence, the application is considered unitary, the examiner will follow 
the decision of the Review Panel and send a final ISR with no indication of 
non-unity. In Section IV of the WO-ISA the examiner will indicate that the 
requirement of unity of invention is complied with and that the search report 
has been established in respect of all parts of the application; no reasons 
need to be given on the separate sheet. Under Section V, an opinion as to 
novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability for all claims will be given.

Rule 40.2(c)
GL/ISPE 10.66-10.69


Part B – Chapter VII-4
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

If the applicant has paid additional search fees under protest and the 
Review Panel decided that the protest was not justified, the examiner will 
follow the decision of the Review Panel and proceed to establish the ISR 
and WO-ISA for the inventions for which search fees have been paid. In the 
ISR and the WO-ISA (Section IV) the examiner will indicate that the 
requirement of unity is not complied with. Section III will be modified to the 
actual payment of fees, and under Section V an opinion as to novelty, 
inventive step and industrial applicability for all searched inventions will be 
given.

The final ISR and WO-ISA will be sent out together with the decision on 
protest (Form PCT/ISA/212) in order to ensure that both are consistent.

See also below (GL/PCT-EPO B-VII, 7), for the protest procedure and the 
work of the Review Panel.

7.
Protest procedure

The procedure consists of a review within the ISA first by the formalities 
officer in charge of the file and then by a Review Panel.

7.1
Admissibility of the protest as checked by the formalities officer

Before initiating the protest procedure the formal admissibility of the protest 
in the sense of Rule 40.2(c) (Chapter I) must be checked.

To be admissible the protest should satisfy the following requirements:

(a)
The applicant must have paid the prescribed protest fee 
(Rule 40.2(e)), and

(b)
The payment under protest must be accompanied by a reasoned 
statement, i.e. the reasoned statement should have been filed with 
the payment or at the latest within the time limit set in Form 206.

The reasoned statement must comply with Rule 40.2(c); i.e. applicants 
should argue why the international application complies with the 
requirement of unity of invention or why the amount of the required 
additional fee is excessive. In the protest applicants should question the 
number of additional fees that they have been invited to pay, and not the 
amount of a single additional fee.

The payment of the protest fee and the filing of a purported reasoned 
statement are assessed by specially trained formalities officers. If the 
formalities officer finds any deficiencies, the applicant is informed of them 
by way of Form 212 or Form 224. Any substantive analysis is made by the 
Review 
Panel 
when 
assessing 
the 
justification 
of 
the 
protest 

(see GL/PCT-EPO B-VII, 7.2). If the applicant merely submits a statement 
of disagreement without reasoning, the Review Panel will refer to the 
reasoning contained in the invitation to pay additional search fees 
(Form 206) when taking its decision.

40.2(e)

and 10.69

Part B – Chapter VII-5

7.2
The work of the Review Panel

If the applicant pays the additional fees under protest and the protest is 
found admissible, the case is referred to the director to appoint a three-
member Review Panel, which comprises the examiner in charge, an 
examiner as chairperson of the Review Panel and a further examiner. This 
Review Panel will, in case of entry into the European phase, constitute the 
Examining Division. The names of the members of the Review Panel are 
made public on Form 212.

The Review Panel is appointed from the moment that the protest is found 
admissible. Its purpose is to determine, on the basis of the protest, whether 
the request for payment of additional fees by the examiner was justified on 
the basis of the reasoning given (see W 11/93). The review does not allow 
a re-evaluation to determine possible additional grounds for lack of unity 
(see W 9/07, Reasons 2.8).

The scope of the review is limited to those inventions for which additional 
fees have been paid. If the applicant's reasoning is not related to those 
inventions, the Review Panel will come to the conclusion that the protest is 
not or is only partially justified, depending on the case.

If the Review Panel determines that the protest is wholly justified, it will 
inform the applicant with Form 212 (Decision on Protest Chapter I). This 
also applies if the Review Panel's finding results in the application not 
lacking unity. It is not necessary to give any reasons unless the Review 
Panel decides that such reasoning would be beneficial. Furthermore, the 
Review Panel will order the reimbursement of all the additional fees and the 
protest fee. The search will be carried out and the written opinion 
established for the inventions for which the fees are paid (see 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VII, 6.3).

If the Review Panel considers that the protest is not justified at all, it will 
communicate this to the applicant using Form 212. Reasoning must be 
given, indicating why the request for payment of additional fees is upheld 
and addressing the applicant's relevant arguments. The search will be 
carried out and the written opinion established for the inventions for which 
the fees are paid (see GL/PCT-EPO B-VII, 6.3).

If the Review Panel considers that the protest is only partially justified, it will 
communicate this to the applicant using Form 212. Reasoning must be 
given, indicating why the request for payment of additional fees is partially 
upheld and addressing the applicant's relevant arguments. The search will 
be carried out and the written opinion established for the inventions for 
which the fees are paid (see GL/PCT-EPO B-VII, 6.3). The Review Panel 
will order the reimbursement of the corresponding additional fees but not 
the protest fee.

The formalities officer will send the decision of the Review Panel to the 
applicant and the IB. The decision on protest (Form 212) will be sent out 
together with the final ISR and WO-ISA in order to ensure that both are 
consistent.

Part B – Chapter VII-6
PCT-EPO Guidelines

After an invitation to pay additional search fees, the applicant may pay all of 
the additional fees under protest. If the Review Panel confirms the initial 
finding of lack of unity by finding the protest not justified, and if the 
application enters the European phase with unamended claims, the 
Examining Division will, as a rule, confirm the lack of unity and request the 
applicant to limit the claims to one invention and to file (a) divisional 
application(s) for the other invention(s). Alternatively, the applicant may 
amend the claims to render them unitary.

Chapter VIII – Subject-matter to be excluded 
from the search

1.
General remarks

The aim of the EPO as ISA is to issue international search reports which 
are as complete as possible. Nevertheless, there are situations in which the 
search report and the written opinion cover only part of the subject-matter 
claimed, or in which no search report is issued. This may be either because 
the international application includes subject-matter which the ISA is not 
required to deal with (see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 2) or else because the 
description, claims or drawings fail to meet a requirement, such as clarity or 
support of the claims by the description, to such an extent that no 
meaningful search can be made of all or some of the claims (see 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3). Applications of the latter kind are often referred to 
as "complex applications".

The same approach is taken as for European applications.

In principle, a declaration of no search under Art. 17(2)(a)(ii) should remain 
an exception. Under the PCT, even if the applicant amends the claims to 
overcome the objection, an additional search is not possible. When a 
declaration of no search is issued, the search must be performed at the 
examination stage without requesting an additional fee if the international 
application enters the European phase before the EPO and if the objection 
leading to the declaration has been overcome (GL/EPO C-IV, 7.3). 
Therefore, at least some effort should be made to carry out a meaningful 
search of at least part of the claimed subject-matter.

2.
Subject-matter which the ISA is not required to search and 

examine
Art. 17(2)(a)(i) and Art. 34(4)(a)(i) together with Rules 39 and 67.1 are the 
equivalents of Art. 52(2), (3) and 53(b), (c) EPC concerning the exclusion 
from patentability of non-technical inventions, programs for computers, 
methods of doing business, medical methods and the exception to 
patentability for plant or animal varieties or essentially biological processes 
for the production of plants and animals, respectively. Since the PCT 
procedure does not lead to a grant, subject-matter which would be 
excluded from patentability under the EPC is identified as subject-matter for 
which the ISA and/or the IPEA is not required to carry out search and 
international preliminary examination.

The criteria applied for the decision not to perform an international search 
are the same as for the European procedure. This means that the 
discretion of an ISA not to search subject-matter set forth in Rule 39.1 is 
exercised by the EPO as ISA only to the extent that such subject-matter is 
not searched under the provisions of the EPC.

For subject-matter which the ISA is not required to search under 
Art. 17(2)(a)(i) and where, as a consequence, an incomplete search report 
will be issued, the restriction should always be indicated both in the search 
report and in the WO-ISA.

Where the subject-matter of all claims constitutes a subject excluded from 
the search, a declaration of non-establishment of the international search 
report is issued pursuant to Article 17(2)(a)
on Form PCT/ISA/203, 

indicating the reasons. A written opinion is established, even though, in the 
absence of a search, it cannot address the questions of novelty and 
inventive step and may not be able to address other questions, such as that 
of industrial applicability. The written opinion should contain full reasoning 
as to why the search is not possible.

2.1
Methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery 

or therapy and diagnostic methods practised on the human or animal 
body
Claims directed to medical treatment which would fall under the exceptions 
to patentability under Art. 53(c) EPC should, in principle, also be exempted 
from international search.

Yet the EPO as ISA applies the same practice as for European 
applications, and the examiner will explain so in the WO-ISA.

In the table below, several types of claim involving a composition A or 
substance X in methods of treatment or diagnosis (hereinafter referred to 
as medical treatment) are listed. Depending on the situation, some of these 
could be patentable in an EP application (see also GL/EPO G-VI, 6.1).

For claims of type (a), (b) or (c), the examiner will search and examine the

that novelty and inventive step have been assessed according to EPO 
practice. The reason for adding this remark is that under Art. 54(4) and (5) 
EPC it is possible to obtain patent protection for any substance or 
composition comprised in the state of the art, for any use or specific use, 
respectively, in a (medical) method referred to in Art. 53(c) EPC, provided 
that such use is not comprised in the state of the art. Claims seeking this 
kind of protection may be drafted as "Substance X for use as a 
medicament/for use in therapy" or "Substance X for use in the treatment of 
disease Y", respectively. See also GL/EPO G-VI, 6.1.

For claims of type (d) or (h), the examiner will search and examine the 
claims and assess the novelty and inventive step thereof, as is the case for 
an EP application. In the WO-ISA, a remark will be added that novelty and 
inventive step have been assessed according to EPO practice.

For claims of type (i) or (j), the examiner will search and examine the claims 
and assess the novelty and inventive step of the indicated uses. In the 
WO-ISA, a remark regarding EPO practice with regard to such claims will 
be added.

For claims of type (e), (f), (g) or (k), in the vast majority of cases, a search 
report is established on the basis of the alleged effects of the 
product/composition, because their subject-matter can readily and in a 
straightforward manner be understood in terms of these effects. For 
reasons of efficiency an opinion on novelty, inventive step and industrial 
applicability will be given for (at least) the independent claims, as far as 
relating to the alleged effects of the compound/composition, as would be 
done for an EP application. A reservation concerning patentability will be 
added, indicating that at the EPO claims directed to a method of treatment 
or the use of a composition in a treatment are exempted from patentability, 
but that a claim directed to a composition or substance for such use would 
be admissible.

In some cases, no search report can be established for claims of type (e), 
(f), (g) or (k), because their subject-matter cannot readily and in a 
straightforward manner be understood in terms of the alleged effects of the 
compound/composition. For these claims, no assessment under Art. 33(1), 
i.e. novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability, will be carried out.

2.2
Subject-matter according to Rules 39.1(i), (iii), (v) and (vi)

Section B-VIII, 2.2 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

The EPO applies options A9.07[2] and A9.15[2] of the Appendix to 
Chapter 9 of the ISPE Guidelines.

2.2.1
Computer-implemented business methods

As a result of an amendment to the Agreement between the EPO and 
WIPO under the PCT, any national or resident of the United States of 
America filing an international application on or after 1 January 2015 with 
the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) or the IB as 
receiving Office will be able to select the EPO as ISA irrespective of the 
technical field in which the application is classified. It should, however, be 
noted that the Notice from the EPO dated 1 October 2007 concerning 
business methods remains applicable. Therefore, the EPO as ISA will, in all 
cases where the subject-matter of the international application involves 
technical means, consider the application and to the extent possible 
provide a search report for those parts of it which are more than mere 
business methods.

Section B-VIII, 2.2.1 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

3.
No meaningful search possible

The meaning of the word "meaningful" in the context of Art. 17(2)(a)(ii) is 
essentially a matter for the examiner to decide. The examiner's finding may 
change in the light of any reply from the applicant to the invitation for 
informal clarification, if available (see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.3 and 3.4). 
The exercise of the examiner's discretion will depend upon the facts of the 
case.

The term "meaningful search" in Article 17(2)(a)(ii) should be read to 
include a search that within reason is complete enough to determine 
whether the claimed invention complies with the substantive requirements, 
that is, the novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability requirements, 
and/or the sufficiency, support and clarity requirements of Articles 5 and 6. 
Accordingly, a finding of "no meaningful search" should be limited to 
exceptional situations in which no search at all is possible for a particular 
claim, for example where the description, the claims or the drawings are 
totally unclear. To the extent that the description, the claims or the drawings 
can be sufficiently understood, even though parts of the application are not 
in compliance with the prescribed requirements, a search should be 
performed recognising that the non-compliance may have to be taken into 
account for determining the extent of the search.

As there is no legal provision providing that an applicant must formulate the 
application in such a way as to make an economical search possible, 
"reasons of economy" cannot be used as a reason, or part of a reason, for 
issuing an incomplete search report.

Part B – Chapter VIII-5

3.1
Examples of impossibility to perform a meaningful search over 

the whole of the claimed scope
A number of non-limiting examples will illustrate where a restriction of the 
search may find application:

(i)
claims lacking support; insufficient disclosure

One example would be a claim so broadly formulated that at least 
part of its scope is speculative, i.e. not supported by the disclosure of 
the application. In this case the broadness of the claim is such as to 
render a meaningful search over the whole of the claim impossible, 
and a meaningful search can be performed only on the basis of the 
narrower, disclosed invention, for example only on the basis of that 
part of the claim which is supported. In extreme cases, this may 
mean a search directed to only one or more of the specific examples 
disclosed in the description. The examiner should bear in mind that 
the requirements under Art. 5 and 6 concerning sufficiency of 
disclosure and support should be seen from the perspective of the 
person skilled in the art.

(ii)
claims lacking conciseness

An example would be where there are so many claims, or so many 
possibilities within a claim, that it becomes unduly burdensome to 
determine the matter for which protection is sought (for the case of 
multiple 
independent 
claims 
in 
the 
same 
category 

see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 4). A complete search (or any search at all) 
may de facto be impossible.

It is noted that the EPO allows multiple dependent claims, provided 
that they do not detract from the clarity of the claims as a whole and 
that the arrangement of claims does not create obscurity in the 
definition of the subject-matter to be protected (see also 
GL/PCT-EPO F-IV, 3.4). In case of unclarity, it may be appropriate 
for the examiner to first invite the applicant for informal clarification 
before the search is carried out (see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.3-3.6).

(iii)
claims lacking clarity

An example would be where the applicant's choice of parameter to 
define the invention renders a meaningful comparison with the prior 
art impossible, perhaps because the prior art has not employed the 
same parameter, or has employed no parameter at all. In such a 
case, the parameter chosen by the applicant may lack clarity 
(see Art. 6; cf. GL/PCT-EPO F-IV, 4.11). It may be that the lack of 
clarity of the parameter is such as to render a meaningful search of 
the claims or of a claim or of a part of a claim impossible, because 
the choice of parameter renders a sensible comparison of the 
claimed invention with the prior art impossible. If so, the search may 
possibly be restricted to the worked examples, as far as they can be 
understood, or to the way in which the desired parameter is obtained.

In all examples listed above, the examiner may where appropriate 
informally invite the applicant to provide clarification of the claimed 
subject-matter (see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.3).

See ISPE Guidelines 9.01 and 9.19-9.30 for further information.

3.2
Nucleotide and amino acid sequences

If the sequence listing of an international application is not available or does 
not comply with WIPO Standard ST.26 (see Annex C to the Administrative 
Instructions, paragraph 4), the EPO as ISA will invite the applicant to 
furnish a sequence listing complying with the standard or a translation in 
the form of a new sequence listing in a language acceptable to it, as the 
case may be, and pay a late furnishing fee, and to perform these steps
within a non-extendable time limit of one month from the date of the 
invitation.

If, within the time limit set, the applicant has not submitted an ST.26-
compliant sequence listing and paid the late furnishing fee, the EPO as ISA 
will carry out the international search without the sequence listing to the 
extent that a meaningful search can be carried out.

The examiner when performing the search will either:

(i)
issue a declaration under Art. 17(2)(a)(ii) and Rule 13ter.1(d) that no 
meaningful search on any claimed subject-matter is possible due to 
the failure of the applicant to comply with Rule 5.2 (no sequence 
listing) and/or Rule 13ter.1(a)
(no computer-readable sequence 

listing);

or

(ii)
issue an incomplete search report with a declaration under 
Art. 17(2)(b) and Rule 13ter.1(d) that a meaningful search is not 
possible in respect of certain claimed subject-matter due to the 
failure to comply with Rule 5.2
(no sequence listing) and/or 

Rule 13ter.1(a) (no computer-readable sequence listing).

This also has consequences for the international preliminary examination 
procedure before the EPO as IPEA (see GL/PCT-EPO C-VIII, 2.1).

3.3
Informal clarification

Where the description, claims or drawings fail to comply with a requirement, 
such as clarity or support of the claims by the description, to such an extent 
that no meaningful search can be made, the examiner may informally 
contact the applicant to clarify specific aspects of the application before the 
search is carried out. Such informal clarification may help the examiner to 
focus the search better. It is highly recommended to invite the applicant to 
provide such informal clarification before issuing an incomplete ISR or a 
declaration of no search. However, there is no legal obligation on the 
examiner to use it and no legal consequences in the PCT if the applicant 
does not respond. An incomplete search report or a declaration of no 
search may still be issued without prior clarification.

PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part B – Chapter VIII-7

Informal clarification may take the form of a telephone consultation or of a 
written request (Form PCT/ISA/207). In both cases the applicant can be 
given a short time limit (normally two weeks) to respond.

Any reference to the "applicant" in GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.3.1 and 3.3.2
includes any duly appointed agent. 

3.3.1
Informal clarification by telephone

In view of the short time limits in the PCT, a telephone consultation, for 
which minutes must be written, may be more appropriate. If the issues at 
stake can be clarified during the telephone consultation, no time limit will be 
given. If not, the short time limit referred to in GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.3 will 
be set. In the former case, the examiner will send the minutes of the 
consultation for information and will prepare the ISR and WO-ISA taking the 
result of the consultation into account. In the latter case, the examiner will 
send minutes setting the time limit, and wait for this time limit to expire 
before preparing the ISR and WO-ISA. They will take into consideration any 
on-time reply received from the applicant.

Where the applicant is registered for the EPO Mailbox service and/or PCT 
Link, the minutes will be sent to the Mailbox. Where the applicant is not so 
registered and the minutes set a time limit for reply, they are sent by regular 
mail and an email is also sent to the applicant to inform them accordingly. If 
an email address for the applicant is not available, the EPO acting as ISA 
may contact them by telephone to request one. Only if one is provided will 
an email be sent. Where the applicant is not registered for the EPO Mailbox 
service and/or PCT Link and the minutes do not set a time limit for reply, 
the minutes are sent by regular mail and no email is sent.

The EPO no longer issues urgent notifications by fax. The minutes of a 
telephone consultation will therefore no longer be communicated by this 
means.

3.3.2
Informal clarification by written request

Alternatively, a written request for clarification can be sent. This is in 
particular appropriate when dealing with non-European representatives due 
to potential time zone differences and linguistic problems, and/or when the 
issue to be discussed is not suitable for a telephone consultation.

Where the applicant is registered for the EPO Mailbox service and/or PCT 
Link, the written request will be sent to the Mailbox. Where the applicant is 
not so registered, the written request is sent by regular mail and an email is 
also sent to the applicant to inform them accordingly. If an email address 
for the applicant is not available, the EPO acting as ISA may contact them 
by telephone to request one. Only if one is provided will an email be sent.

The EPO no longer issues urgent notifications by fax. An informal written 
request for clarification will therefore no longer be communicated by this 
means.

3.4
Reply to the invitation for informal clarification

3.4.1
Failure to reply in time or no reply

If the applicant does not reply within the set time limit to the invitation for 
informal clarification, the examiner will prepare the search report and 
WO-ISA to the extent possible without the requested clarification.

If the applicant replies after the time limit has expired, and the search report 
has not yet been established, the reply should be taken into account; if the 
search report has already been established the reply will not be taken into 
account.

3.4.2
Reply in time

If the applicant replies to the invitation for informal clarification, the 
examiner will prepare the search report and WO-ISA taking the reply into 
account.

3.5
The content of the WO-ISA after an invitation for informal 

clarification and/or in case of a restriction of the search
Generally, a restriction of the search will not always be indicated in the 
international search report. Rather the extent of the search as well as the 
reasons for the restriction will in many cases only be indicated in the 
WO-ISA, as explained below. The opinion given is normally restricted to 
what has actually been searched.

If after clarification a complete search can be made, the ISR will be 
designated as complete. Any outstanding clarity problem will be mentioned 
in Box VIII of the WO-ISA.

If only some of the claims and/or parts of the claims can be searched and it 
is not possible, on the basis of the description, to foresee a likely fallback 
position for the unsearched subject-matter, even taking any reply from the 
applicant into consideration, a precise indication of what has been 
searched with the corresponding claims, together with full reasoning why 
the search was restricted, are entered into both the ISR and the WO-ISA. In 
addition, in the WO-ISA an opinion as to novelty, inventive step and 
industrial applicability of the searched subject-matter must be given.

If some claims or parts of claims cannot be searched but it is possible, on 
the basis of the description, to foresee a searchable fallback position, 
taking any possible reply from the applicant into consideration, the ISR will 
be filled out as for a complete search in respect of those claims. An 
indication which claims have been searched (in part), together with full 
reasoning why the search was restricted, and a precise indication of what 
has been searched are entered into the WO-ISA. In the ISR the cited 
documents will relate to the searched (or partially searched) claims only. In 
addition, in the WO-ISA an opinion as to novelty, inventive step and 
industrial applicability of the searched subject-matter must be given.

If, even taking any reply from the applicant into consideration, it is not 
possible to perform a search at all, a declaration of no search, together with

full reasoning why, is issued instead of the ISR. The WO-ISA must contain 
full reasoning why the search is not possible.

A restriction of the search due to exceptions mentioned in Rule 39
(e.g. medical treatment claims) must always be indicated in the search 
report.

3.6
Combination of an incomplete search and lack of unity

The requirements of unity of invention and the requirements of 
Art. 17(2)(a)(ii) are separate requirements. However, it is possible that an 
application both violates the requirements of clarity, disclosure, support or 
conciseness to such an extent that a meaningful search cannot be carried 
out, and lacks unity. In that case, the examiner can combine an incomplete 
search and a finding of non-unity. However, the applicant should not be 
invited to pay additional fees for subject-matter which will later not be 
searched under Art. 17(2)(a)(ii). Typically, a non-unity objection could be 
made first and then an incomplete search applied to the searched 
invention. In such a case the examiner may send an informal clarification 
request for the first invention only and include in the invitation to pay 
additional fees remarks on clarity problems related to further inventions.

However, if the complexity lies in lack of clarity, the search will be restricted 
first, and the non-unity objection applied to the clear parts of the claimed 
subject-matter.

4.
Multiple independent claims per category

Multiple independent claims in one category are per se not a reason for an 
incomplete search.

Generally, an opinion must be given on all searched claims. Only one 
independent claim in each category needs to be treated in detail; short 
comments would normally suffice for further independent claims.

Furthermore, if appropriate, an objection as to clarity and conciseness 
under Article 6 may be made under Box VIII of the WO-ISA. The EPO as 
ISA may exercise its discretion to ask the applicant to clarify the 
subject-matter to be searched, applying the same procedure as described 
under GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.3-3.4.

Chapter X – Search report

1.
General

The results of the search will be recorded in an international search report. 
A number of different possible limitations of the scope of the search report 
exist. These are:

(i)
a declaration issued instead of the search report according to 
Art. 17(2)(a) (see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII);

(ii)
an 
incomplete 
search 
report 
according 
to 
Art. 17(2)(b)

(see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII);

(iii)
a partial international search report due to a finding of a lack of unity 
according to Art. 17(3)(a) and Rule 13; and

(iv)
an incomplete search report due to missing sequence listings 
(see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.2).

The Search Division is responsible for drawing up the international search 
report (see GL/PCT-EPO B-I, 2 and subsections).

This chapter contains the information which is necessary to enable the 
examiner to correctly prepare the search report.

A search report must contain no matter, in particular no expressions of 
opinion, reasoning, arguments or explanations, other than that required by 
the Form or referred to in GL/PCT-EPO B-X, 9.2.8. However, this does not 
apply to the written opinion (see GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 3).

2.
Different types of search reports drawn up by the EPO as ISA

The EPO in its capacity as ISA will draw up the following types of search 
reports:

(i)
international search reports under the PCT;

(ii)
international-type search reports. For details, reference is made to

Record of search strategy

Since 1 November 2015, all search reports drawn up by the EPO under 
both the PCT and EP procedures, including partial search reports, have 
been automatically supplemented with an information sheet entitled 
"Information on Search Strategy". If the application lacks unity of invention, 
the data contained in this sheet only concerns the invention(s) for which the 
search fee(s) has (have) been paid. The information sheet is automatically 
generated based on the data entered by the examiner when drawing up the 
search report. It lists the databases in which the examiner conducted the 
prior-art search, the classification symbols defining the extent of the search, 
and the keywords selected by the examiner or any other element relating to 
the invention to be searched and used to retrieve the relevant prior art.

Upon publication of a search report drawn up under the PCT procedure, the 
information sheet will be made available to the public via file inspection on 
WIPO's PATENTSCOPE.

7.
Title, abstract and figure(s) to be published with the abstract (as 

indicated on supplemental sheet A)
The international application must contain an abstract and a title (see also 
GL/PCT-EPO F-II, 2 and 3). If the search report is published together with 
the application (A1 publication), the examiner indicates on supplemental 
sheet A:

(i)
the approval or amendment of the text of the abstract, which should 
not exceed 150 words;

(ii)
the approval or amendment of the title of the invention (see also 
GL/PCT-EPO H-III, 7); and

(iii)
the figure which is to accompany the abstract. It is possible to 
indicate multiple figures from various sheets, but the overall size 
should not exceed what could fit on an A4 sheet.

If the application is to be published before the international search report is 
prepared (A2 publication, see GL/EPO B-X, 4), the examiner only needs to 
prepare the classification data. Titles, abstracts and figures are published 
as submitted by the applicant.

Restriction of the subject of the search

In the following cases, the international search report, the declaration 
issued instead of the search report under Art. 17(2)(a), or the incomplete or 
partial search report will indicate whether the subject of the search was 
restricted and which claims have or have not been searched:

(i)
lack of unity of invention (see GL/PCT-EPO B-VII).

(ii)
claims in respect of which no meaningful search or only an 
incomplete search can be carried out (see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII).

In case (ii), the following situations may occur:

(a)
A declaration that a meaningful search has not been possible 
on the basis of all claims is issued instead of the search report; 
or

(b)
If a meaningful search has not been possible for one or more 
of the claims in part or in full, the claims concerned are 
mentioned in the incomplete search report and/or in the written 
opinion.

In case (a), the reasons for not carrying out the search should be 
indicated in the declaration.

In case (b), a limitation of the search will not always be indicated in 
the ISR. Rather, the extent of the search as well as the reasons for 
the restriction will in many cases only be indicated in the WO-ISA. 
See GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.5, for details of whether an indication 
under Art. 17 should be made in the ISR or only in the WO-ISA.

9.2.4
Use of "P" documents in the search report

Although "P" documents are normally not used for the further examination 
they should be indicated in the search report since they might become 
pertinent at a later national stage. The EPO as ISA also cites non-patent 
literature P-X documents in the search report. If the priority document is not 
available to the examiner at the time of the search, it will be assumed that 
the priority is valid for the purpose of establishing the search report and 
written opinion. For the relevant dates for conducting the search, see 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VI, 3.

Chapter XI – The written opinion

1.
The written opinion

Under Chapter I, at the same time as establishing the search report the 
search examiner must establish the written opinion of the ISA (WO-ISA) to 
be sent to the applicant together with the search report. The WO-ISA gives 
a preliminary and non-binding opinion on whether the claimed invention 
appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step and to be industrially 
applicable. When appropriate, an opinion will also be given on added 
subject-matter, unity, insufficient disclosure and clarity or support issues, as 
well as formal defects.

The findings of the written opinion must be consistent with the document 
categories assigned in the search report and must also be consistent with 
any other issues raised in the search report, such as lack of unity of 
invention or limitation of the search.

If there are no defects in the application, the WO-ISA will state the reasons 
why the application is considered to fulfil the requirements of novelty, 
inventive step and industrial applicability.

The written opinion (and any informal comments filed by the applicant) will 
be made available to the public by the IB at the same time as the 
international publication.

If the application subsequently enters the EP phase, the applicant is 
obliged to reply to any negative WO-ISA or IPRP/IPER. The WO-ISA is 
thus comparable to the ESOP in the European procedure.

2.
Basis of the written opinion (WO-ISA)

Applicants cannot amend the application before the search report has been 
communicated to them. Consequently, the WO-ISA will always relate to the 
application documents as originally filed or a translation thereof, and 
subject to the possibility of sequence listings being furnished later for the 
purposes of international search (see Rule 13ter.1). Furthermore, any reply 
filed by the applicant in response to an invitation for informal clarification 
(see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.4) will also be taken into consideration when 
drawing up the written opinion.

Replacement pages or sheets, filed in response to an invitation by the 
receiving Office to correct defects in the international application, are 
deemed to be part of the international application "as originally filed". These 
sheets are identified with a stamp "SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)" (see 
GL/PCT-EPO H-IV, 1). Also, replacement pages or sheets for rectification 
of obvious mistakes under Rule 91 (see GL/PCT-EPO H-IV, 2) are deemed 
to be part of the international application "as originally filed". These sheets 
are identified with "RECTIFIED SHEET (RULE 91.1)".

See GL/PCT-EPO H-IV, 2, for the procedure to follow if the rectified sheets 
contain added subject-matter.

Part B – Chapter XI-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

2.1
Applications containing missing parts or elements, or correct 

parts or elements, incorporated by reference
If applicants omit to file part(s) of the application and/or (an) entire 
element(s) thereof (i.e. all of the description and/or all of the claims), they 
may still furnish it (them) at a later date without affecting the international 
filing date, subject to the requirements of Rules 4.18 and Rule 20.6(a) and 
provided the missing part(s) and/or element(s) was (were) completely 
contained in the priority document.

Similarly, if applicants appear to have erroneously filed part(s) of the 
application and/or (an) entire element(s) thereof (i.e. all of the description 
and/or all of the claims), they may still furnish the correct part(s) and/or 
element(s) at a later date without affecting the international filing date, 
subject to the requirements of Rules 4.18 and 20.6(a) and provided the 
correct part(s) and/or element(s) were completely contained in the priority 
document.

The activity of the EPO as ISA depends on the decisions taken by the RO 
with regard to the international application and its filing date; see also 
GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 6. 
Therefore, 
in 
cases 
where 
the 
international 

application was corrected by the RO under Rule 20.5bis, the EPO as ISA 
will establish the written opinion on the basis of the international application 
including the correct element(s) and/or part(s) if:

(a)
the RO notifies it of the correct element(s) and/or part(s) before the 
start of the search; or

(b)
the RO notifies it of the correct element(s) and/or part(s) after the 
start of the search (including after its completion) and the applicant 
pays an additional fee equal to the search fee within one month of 
the date of the invitation to do so issued by the EPO (Rule 40bis.1
and Article 2(1) RFees) (see GL/PCT-EPO B-III, 2.3.4).

See GL/PCT-EPO B-III, 2.3.3.

The examiner must check (as far as the documents needed are available) 
whether the RO's assessment of the "completely contained" criterion was 
correct (see GL/PCT-EPO H-II, 2.2.2). See also GL/PCT-EPO B-III, 2.3.3
and GL/PCT-EPO H-II, 2.2.2.2, for the impact on the search report and 
WO-ISA.

2.2
Applications filed in Dutch

The EPO acting as ISA accepts international applications drawn up in 
Dutch if the application was filed with the Netherlands patent office as RO.

Therefore, for such files, a translation is not required for the purpose of the 
international search by the EPO as ISA. However, under Rule 12.4(a), 
within 14 months of the priority date, a translation must be filed with the RO 
in a language of publication accepted by the RO for the purpose of 
international publication, i.e. English, French or German in the case of the 
Netherlands patent office as RO. The EPO as ISA will establish the ISR 
and WO-ISA in that language if it is already known at the time of carrying

Guide, International Phase, Annex C, NL.

3.
Analysis of the application and content of the written opinion

3.1
The search division's dossier

Section B-XI, 3.1 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

3.2
Reasoned objections

3.2.1
Opinion on novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability

The opinion given in the WO-ISA is restricted to what has actually been 
searched; this should also be made clear in the WO-ISA.

A full explanation of the conclusions reached should always be given for all 
searched claims, regardless of whether this conclusion is positive or 
negative. Normally only one independent claim in each category is treated 
in detail; for negative conclusions regarding further independent claims, as 
well as for dependent claims, comments may be shorter.

3.2.2
Multiple independent claims

Multiple independent claims in one category are per se not a reason for a 
restriction of the search (see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 4).

If appropriate, an objection as to clarity and conciseness under Article 6
may be made under Box VIII (see GL/PCT-EPO F-IV, 3.2). As an 
alternative, for cases where multiple independent claims in one category do 
not affect the clarity of the definition of the invention, a minor objection may 
be raised under Box VII.

3.2.3
Dependent claims – WO-ISA

Dependent claims should be indicated as complying or not with the 
requirements of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. Short 
statements of the reasons why the claims do not comply with these 
requirements should be given on the separate sheet. At the discretion of 
the examiner, more detailed comments may be made about selected 
dependent claims. If any claims are found to be novel and inventive, brief 
reasons for this too should be given on the separate sheet.

3.2.4
Clarity, conciseness, support and formal defects – WO-ISA

Major clarity, conciseness or support issues will be mentioned under 
Box VIII, unless they result in a meaningful search being impossible, in 
which case they will be treated under Section III.

Formal defects (e.g. reference signs, two-part form, acknowledgment of 
prior-art documents, etc.) as well as minor clarity issues will be dealt with 
under Box VII.

GL/ISPE 5.13 and 
5.14


Part B – Chapter XI-4
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

If the application is severely deficient and it is clear that the claims will have 
to be drastically redrafted anyway, it is not necessary to make objections 
with respect to minor clarity issues and/or formal issues.

3.3
Making suggestions

It is possible to make suggestions in the written opinion as to how certain 
objections raised may be overcome. However, examiners must not actually, 
of their own volition, make any final amendments to the application 
documents, however minor, for the reason that only amendments submitted 
by the applicant may be taken into consideration for the IPER. In no 
circumstances should the impression be given that compliance with the 
suggestions would lead to an allowable application under the EPC or any 
national law.

If no demand for Chapter II is filed, the WO-ISA will automatically be 
converted into an IPRP Chapter I. Therefore, the WO-ISA should not 
contain formulations suggesting to the applicant to actively file submissions.

3.4
Positive or negative WO-ISA

The examiner needs to indicate whether the WO-ISA is to be considered 
positive or negative for further prosecution. The reason for this is that when 
entering the European phase the applicant is required to respond to the 
WO-ISA if it is negative, but not if it is positive (see GL/EPO E-IX, 3.3.2).

As a general rule, a WO-ISA is considered positive if it contains no 
objections at all or only minor objections which would not hinder a direct 
grant in the EP phase.

In the special case where the search report cites P and/or E documents but 
the priority could not be checked and there are no other objections, the 
WO-ISA is considered positive (since the examiner in the European phase 
first has to evaluate the validity of the priority and then decide whether a 
grant is still possible).

On the other hand, if the relevance of the document is independent of the 
priority being valid, detailed reasons for the novelty objection will be given, 
as well as an indication to the applicant that such a document would be 
relevant when entering the European phase before the EPO.

In the case of method of treatment claims which can easily be reformulated 
into an allowable format (see also GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 2.1), the above 
applies as well; i.e. if this is the only objection, the WO-ISA will be 
considered positive since such a reformulation can be done by the 
examiner at the grant stage in the European phase before the EPO.

In the special case of a non-unitary application, where all inventions 
searched were found to be novel and inventive, but still lacking unity – as 
the only objection – the WO-ISA is marked as negative.

4.
Priority claim and the WO-ISA

Normally, priority need only be checked if a relevant P or E document is 
found during the search. However, there may also be cases where the 

GL/ISPE 3.05, 17.71

GL/ISPE 17.28-17.29


March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part B – Chapter XI-5

examiner immediately realises that the priority is not valid (e.g. in the case 
of an alleged doublure (see GL/PCT-EPO B-IV, 1.1) or a continuation-in-
part (see GL/PCT-EPO F-VI, 1.4)). Also, in case of restoration of priority 
rights, 
the 
examiner 
may 
insert 
a 
comment 
in 
Box II 
(see 

GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 4.1).

4.1
Restoration of priority

See GL/PCT-EPO F-VI, 3.7.

If the examiner notices that the filing date exceeds the earliest priority date 
plus twelve and two months this may be indicated in the WO-ISA.

4.2
Use of "P" documents in the written opinion

If the priority document is not available, the opinion will be established on 
the assumption that the claimed priority is valid. In this case, no comments 
need be made regarding "P" documents, but the "P" documents will 
nevertheless be indicated under Section VI. For potentially conflicting 
patent documents which might give rise to an objection under Art. 54(3) 
EPC in the European phase, the statements in GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 4.3, 
below regarding "E" documents apply.

If the priority document is available, the examiner will check the validity of 
the priority and indicate any negative finding under Section II. Should the 
priority be found not to be valid, detailed comments will be made for these 
documents with respect to novelty and inventive step of the claimed 
subject-matter under Section V, since these documents then become prior 
art under Rule 33.1(a).

Sometimes it is possible for the examiner to determine from the documents 
on file that the claimed priority is not valid. An example would be when 
during the search a document is found which shows that the priority 
document of the searched application is actually not the first application for 
the claimed invention.

4.3
Use of "E" documents in the written opinion

Although there are no harmonised provisions in the PCT Contracting States 
that correspond to Art. 54(3) EPC, such documents will be mentioned 
under Section VI if they are considered prejudicial to the novelty of at least 
one claim. If the relevance of the document is independent of the priority 
being valid or if the priority could be checked and was found invalid, 
reasons for the novelty objection will be provided, together with an 
indication that such a document would be relevant when entering the 
European phase before the EPO.

On the other hand, if the document would be relevant under Art. 54(3) EPC
only if the priority is not valid, and this could not be checked, then no 
reasons need to be given.

5.
Unity in relation to the written opinion

In the case of lack of unity where more than one invention has been 
searched, for each invention searched one independent claim in each 
category must be treated in detail.

GL/ISPE 17.29(c)


Part B – Chapter XI-6
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

See GL/PCT-EPO B-VII for further details.

6.
The written opinion in cases of a restriction of the search

The extent of the search as well as the reasons for the restriction will in 
many cases only be indicated in the WO-ISA. See GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.5, 
for details of whether an indication under Art. 17 should be made in the ISR 
or only in the WO-ISA. The opinion given is then normally restricted to what 
has actually been searched.

Any argumentation and objections presented in the written opinion must be 
consistent with the restrictions of the search and the reasons therefor. See 
also 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 2, 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3
and 

GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.1.

7.
Sequence listings

Where the applicant has not filed an electronic sequence listing conforming 
to WIPO Standard ST.26 in response to a request from the ISA, or has not 
paid the late furnishing fee, the WO-ISA will indicate under Section III that 
the written opinion is limited to the same extent as the search was limited 
because the applicant failed to comply with Rule 5.2 (no sequence listing) 
and/or Rule 13ter.1(a) (no computer-readable sequence listing).

8.
Options open to the applicant following receipt of the ISR and 

WO-ISA
See ISPE Guidelines 2.15.

Part B – Chapter XII-1

Chapter XII – Supplementary international 
search (SIS)

1.
General

The supplementary international search system is optional for both 
applicants and International Authorities. Its purpose is to enable applicants, 
during the international phase, to obtain further supplementary searches 
from other Authorities so that they have a better basis for deciding whether 
or not to enter the regional phase.

The EPO as SISA only accepts a limited number of SIS requests per year. 
Since 2010, the EPO has limited the number of SIS requests it will accept 
to 700 per year.

2.
Time limits

An applicant can request a SIS up to the end of 22 months from the priority 
date. The request must be filed with the IB.

The SISA must start the search promptly after receipt of the necessary 
documents, though it may delay the start of the search until it has received 
the ISR from the main ISA, but not later than the end of 22 months from the 
priority date.

The supplementary international search report (SISR) must be established 
within 28 months from the priority date so as to allow the applicant to take it 
into account when deciding whether or not to enter the regional/national 
phase.

The file will therefore be sent to the examiner as soon as all the documents 
have been received, including the ISR from the main ISA. If, however, the 
ISR from the main ISA is not received within 22 months of the priority date, 
the file will be sent to the examiner to enable the start of the search.

3.
Basis for the search

The SIS is always made on the claims as originally filed (or a translation 
thereof), irrespective of whether amendments have been filed under Art. 19
or 34.

In cases where the international application was corrected by the RO under 
Rule 20.5bis, the EPO as SISA will carry out the supplementary 
international search on the basis of the international application including 
the pages submitted later and containing the correct element or part. This is 
the version that will have been searched by the main ISA.

4.
Scope of the search

At the EPO the scope of a SIS is the same as for any other international 
search carried out by the EPO as ISA and is not limited to documentation in 
a specific language.

Part B – Chapter XII-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

If an ISR from the main ISA is already available when the examiner carries 
out the SIS, it will be taken into account when establishing the SISR and 
written opinion.

5.
Limitation of the search for reasons other than non-unity

With respect to limitations of the search for reasons other than non-unity 
(including the issuance of a declaration of no search), the same criteria 
apply as for any international search carried out by the EPO as ISA (see 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 2, 3 and subsections).

Any such limitation of the search will be indicated in the search report 
and/or the annexed explanations (of equal value to the information 
contained in a WO-ISA) as set out in GL/PCT-EPO B-X, 8 and B-XI, 6, with 
the exception that in the case of a declaration of no search (Form 
PCT/SISA/502) no explanations from the SISA are provided for. For any 
other limitation of the search, the reasoning will be given only in the 
explanations annexed to the SISR and an automatic reference thereto will 
be inserted in the SISR.

Furthermore, the SISA does not have to search claims which were not 
searched by the main ISA. However, the examiner will not limit the SIS 
merely on the grounds that the main ISA did so, but will make a case-by-
case assessment based on EPO practice to determine whether the 
limitation made by the main ISA was appropriate under EPO practice.

For non-unity: see GL/PCT-EPO B-XII, 10.

6.
Filling out the search report

The SISR is filled out in the same way as for any international search, with 
the exception that publication details do not have to be provided since the 
main ISA has already provided the publication data and IPC classes.

Examiners will not cite in the SISR a document already cited in the ISR 
unless they attach a different significance to it, e.g. as a Y document in 
combination with a newly cited document or where the main ISR has clearly 
failed to recognise the extent of the document's relevance.

Furthermore, it will be indicated in the SISR whether or not the main ISR 
was available and taken into account.

7.
Explanations under Rule 45bis.7(e)

No separate WO-ISA is established for a SIS. Instead, only a free-text 
sheet is used, and this will contain the same information as the separate 
sheet that is part of the WO-ISA in the form of "explanations". Upon entry 
into the European phase, the applicant is obliged to respond to these 
explanations, as set out in Rule 161(1) EPC. A positive conclusion must be 
reasoned in the same way as in a WO-ISA/IPER.

Formally, the explanations under Rule 45bis.7(e) are part of the SISR 
(Form PCT/SISA/501) and are contained in an annex called the "Scope 
Annex".

March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part B – Chapter XII-3

Although the Scope Annex will concentrate on the documents cited in the 
SISR, in some circumstances it might be appropriate to raise objections 
based on documents cited in the ISR.

An example would be that of a document cited in the ISR which could be 
used as a Y document for inventive step for some dependent claims in the 
Scope Annex. In this case it might be necessary to cite the document again 
in the SISR as a Y document for those claims if this was not already 
indicated in the main ISR (see also GL/PCT-EPO B-XII, 6), and to provide 
argumentation in the Scope Annex.

It may also occur that although the EPO as SISA finds further pertinent 
prior art, objections may also be raised based on X and/or Y documents 
cited in the ISR. In such a case, the examiner may choose to base 
objections only on the documents cited in the ISR if considered expedient. 
Should the objections correspond to those raised in the WO-ISA from the 
main ISA, a mere reference to the WO-ISA objections will suffice.

There may also be cases where the ISR contains documents pertinent for 
novelty and/or inventive step and the EPO as SISA cannot find any further 
relevant documents (only possibly A documents). In such a case the 
following two possibilities will arise:

(i)
if the examiner agrees with the categories (X, Y) given in the ISR for 
these documents, it is not necessary to cite the documents again in 
the SISR. The examiner will then use the documents cited in the ISR 
to raise objections of lack of novelty and/or inventive step. If the 
WO-ISA from the main ISA has raised the same objections, and the 
examiner agrees with the given reasoning, a mere reference to the 
objections raised in the WO-ISA from the main ISA will suffice.

(ii)
if the examiner does not agree with some or all of the categories (X, 
Y, A) given in the ISR for any such documents considered pertinent 
and upon which the examiner wishes to base the objections in the 
Scope Annex, such documents will be cited again in the SISR.

In both these cases the A documents found by the EPO as SISA will be 
cited in the SISR.

Generally, an explicit re-evaluation of the objections raised in the WO-ISA 
will be avoided. The examiner will thus refrain from negatively commenting 
on any reasoning given in the WO-ISA, bearing in mind that national law 
differs amongst the PCT contracting states.

8.
Validity of priority and E/P documents

At this stage the priority document should be available in the file and it can 
therefore be checked if E/P documents were found during the search. 
Should the priority document not be available, for the purposes of the 
search the priority is assumed to be valid. No indication in the Scope Annex 
is necessary.


Part B – Chapter XII-4
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

If the priority is not valid, this will be explained in the Scope Annex, and any 
P documents found to be relevant will be dealt with in detail.

On the other hand, if the priority is valid, any cited P documents do not 
need to be dealt with in detail.

Any E document which is a potential Art. 54(3) EPC document will be dealt 
with in the Scope Annex. In this case the applicant's attention should be 
drawn to the relevance of such a document if the application enters the 
European phase before the EPO and a reasoned statement as to lack of 
novelty will be given.

9.
Copies of documents cited in the SISR

The applicant will receive a copy of each document cited in the SISR free of 
charge.

10. Non-unity

10.1 General procedure
In case of non-unity only one invention is searched; there is no possibility to 
pay additional fees for further inventions. Furthermore, the decision as to 
which invention should be considered the main invention and thus 
searched is handled differently for the SIS procedure, as set out in detail in 
GL/PCT-EPO B-XII, 10.2.

Where the main ISA has already objected to lack of unity, the applicant can 
indicate together with the supplementary search request which of the 
inventions should be searched by the SISA. For further details see 
GL/PCT-EPO B-XII, 10.3.

If on the other hand the main ISA has not objected to lack of unity, the EPO 
as SISA is free to do so, as the SISA is not bound by any finding on unity 
made by the ISA but merely obliged to take such a finding into account.

As for any international search where lack of unity is objected to, the 
applicant has the right to protest against the non-unity finding. In the SIS 
procedure this protest is called a review (see GL/PCT-EPO B-XII, 10.4).

10.2 Deciding what is to be considered the main invention
The main invention will normally be the invention first mentioned in the 
claims. However, the examiner will exercise due discretion in selecting the 
invention to be searched where the first mentioned invention is one for 
which no search report would be established, or else where the applicant 
has requested that the supplementary search should be limited to one of 
the inventions other than the first identified by the ISA responsible for the 
main international search. For details, see GL/PCT-EPO B-XII, 10.3.

10.3 The main ISA found that unity of invention is lacking
If the main ISA has already objected to lack of unity and the examiner 
agrees with the assessment in the main ISR, this can be reported by simply 
referring to the ISR.

Part B – Chapter XII-5

If the examiner forms a different point of view, or agrees with a revised view 
on unity of invention in a decision relating to a protest before the ISA, the 
reasoning will be set out in full so that it is easily understood by both the 
applicant and third parties. No reasons need be given why the lack-of-unity 
objection raised in the ISR could not be followed.

If the examiner finds that the application does not lack unity, a complete 
search is made for all the claims. No reasons need be given why the lack-
of-unity objection raised in the ISR could not be followed.

Furthermore, if the main ISA has already objected to lack of unity, the 
applicant can indicate, on the supplementary search request form (in 
Box IV), which of the inventions searched by the main ISA the SIS should 
be based upon.

If the examiner agrees with the assessment of unity of invention made by 
the main ISA and the relevant claims are not excluded for any reason, the 
SIS will focus on the invention indicated by the applicant.

If examiners cannot follow the objection raised in the ISR, but raise a 
different non-unity objection, when deciding on the main invention to be 
searched, they will take the request by the applicant into account as far as 
possible. The examiner will provide complete reasoning for the lack-of-unity 
objection in the SISR and will include an explanation of the extent to which 
the applicant's request could be taken into account in view of the different 
non-unity objection raised by the EPO.

10.4 Review procedure
If applicants do not agree with the finding of lack of unity they can request a 
review of this finding. This procedure is similar to the protest procedure with 
the difference that additional fees cannot be paid.

If applicants request a review of the non-unity finding they must pay a 
review fee. If no fee is paid, the request for review is considered not to have 
been made.

Similar to the protest procedure, a Review Panel is established consisting 
of the examiner responsible for the file, an examiner as chairperson of the 
Review Panel and a further examiner. This Review Panel will, in case of 
entry into the European phase, constitute the Examining Division (see 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VII, 7.2). The examiner dealing with the file will make a first 
assessment of the arguments made by the applicant and will then discuss 
the case with the members of the Review Panel to come to a decision.

The purpose of the Review Panel is to determine whether the lack-of-unity 
objection was justified on the basis of the reasoning given in the SISR. The 
review does not include re-evaluation to determine possible additional 
grounds for lack of unity.

Where the Review Panel determines that the objection was not justified, it 
will inform the applicant with Form 503; no reasoning needs to be given. 

Rule 45bis.6(d)
GL/ISPE 15.91


Part B – Chapter XII-6
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

Furthermore, it will order the reimbursement of the review fee. A corrected 
SISR must then be established on all claims.

If the Review Panel considers that the objection is completely or partially 
justified, it will communicate this to the applicant with Form 503. In these 
cases, reasoning must be given indicating why the objection is (at least 
partially) upheld. This reasoning should also address the applicant's 
relevant arguments. The review fee will not be reimbursed. In the case of 
an only partially justified lack-of-unity objection, a corrected search report 
taking the result of the review into account must be established.

11. Combination of SIS and Chapter II
If the ISA was one of the European International Searching Authorities (SE, 
ES, AT, FI, TR, NPI (XN) or VPI (XV)) the applicant can file a demand 
under Chapter II with the EPO and additionally a request for SIS by the 
EPO.

For such a file the examiner will first establish the SISR with Scope Annex 
and then continue with Chapter II.

Under Chapter II, a WO-IPEA (Form 408) will be sent to the applicant if 
there are objections, since the WO-ISA from another office is not 
recognised as a WO-IPEA (unlike an EPO WO-ISA) and the Scope Annex 
does not legally qualify as a WO-IPEA (see GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 2.1).

Chapter I – Introduction

1.
General remark

Chapters C-II to C-IX set out the general procedure for the international 
preliminary examination under PCT Chapter II, together with guidance on 
particular matters where necessary. They do not provide detailed 
instructions on matters of internal administration.

Matters of substantive law, i.e. the requirements which a PCT application 
must fulfil, are dealt with in Part F, Part G and Part H.

2.
Work of an examiner

See ISPE Guidelines 3.05.

3.
Purpose of international preliminary examination

While the search and the accompanying written opinion under Chapter I are 
mandatory for applicants, examination under Chapter II is optional.

The end product of the PCT procedure is the international preliminary 
report on patentability (IPRP) Chapter I or Chapter II. This report will be the 
result:

i.
either of further examination under Chapter II (see below) in the form 
of an international preliminary examination report (IPER) from the 
International Preliminary Examining Authority

ii.
or, if no demand under Chapter II is filed, of the International 
Bureau's conversion of the WO-ISA into an IPRP of the International 
Searching Authority, which is made public at 30 months from the 
priority date or shortly thereafter together with any informal 
comments submitted by the applicant. Such comments will be 
annexed to the report. Since no demand for preliminary examination 
under Chapter II has been filed, there is no re-examination of the 
WO-ISA.

In its capacity as an International Preliminary Examining Authority 
(i.e. under Chapter II of the PCT), the EPO is empowered to carry out 
international preliminary examination (IPE), the objective of which is to 
formulate a preliminary and non-binding opinion on whether the claimed 
invention appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step and to be 
industrially applicable. When appropriate an opinion will also be given on 
added subject-matter, unity, insufficient disclosure and clarity or support 
issues, as well as formal defects.

The international preliminary examination does not lead to either a grant or 
a refusal of a patent; instead, at the end of the procedure, a report – the 
IPRP Chapter II or IPER – is established. The procedure under Chapter II
allows the applicant to submit amendments and arguments in response to 
the WO-ISA and, if applicable, to a WO-IPEA, which will be taken into 
account when establishing the report.

Part C – Chapter II-1

Chapter II – Formal requirements to be met 
before the start of the international preliminary 
examination

1.
Filing of the demand

The demand for international preliminary examination must be made using 
the prescribed form (PCT/IPEA/401).

A demand for preliminary examination selecting the EPO as IPEA must be 
filed with the EPO in Munich, Berlin or The Hague, in writing, by hand, by 
post, by facsimile or electronically. As of 1 November 2016 the ePCT 
service may be used for online filing of the demand under PCT Chapter II, 
and also for indicating the payment of fees related to the demand.

The EPO will indicate the date of receipt on the demand and promptly notify 
the applicant of that date. If the demand is filed by fax, no written 
confirmation needs to be filed unless the applicant is invited by the EPO as 
IPEA to do so.

If the applicant filed the demand incorrectly with the International Bureau 
(IB), a receiving Office, an International Searching Authority or a non-
competent International Preliminary Examining Authority, that Office or 
Authority or the IB will mark the date of receipt and will transmit the demand 
to the EPO as IPEA.

The time limit for filing the demand for international preliminary examination 
with the EPO is as defined in Rule 54bis.1.

2.
The EPO as competent IPEA

The IPEA receiving the demand should ensure that it is competent to act as 
IPEA.

Although the EPO's competence as an IPEA is not restricted to 
international applications from EPC contracting states, restrictions of 
various nature limit its competence.

In particular, the EPO is competent to act as IPEA only if the international 
search was carried out by the EPO or by the Austrian, Finnish, Spanish, 
Swedish or Turkish patent office, the Nordic Patent Institute (NPI) or the 
Visegrad Patent Institute (VPI).

3.
Identification of the international application in the demand

The international application must be identified by indicating the 
international application number, the international filing date, the title of the 
invention and the name and address of the applicant.

4.
Applicant's entitlement to file a demand

The demand should contain the name and the address (including postal 
code and name of the country) of the applicant, the state of nationality and 
the state of residence.

Part C – Chapter II-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

Sole applicants must have their residence in, or be a national of, a PCT 
contracting state bound by PCT Chapter II. If there is more than one 
applicant, at least one of the applicants has to fulfil these requirements. 
Secondly, the international application must have been filed with a 
receiving Office of or acting for a PCT contracting state bound by PCT 
Chapter II. At present, all PCT contracting states are bound by PCT 
Chapter II. Therefore, these requirements do not stand in the way of any 
applicant wishing to file a demand for a pending international application.

5.
Representation

The demand should indicate the agent or common representative who has 
been appointed by the applicant(s) or a sub-agent who has been appointed 
by an agent appointed under Rule 90.1(a) ("the agent for the international 
phase") (see GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.9).

Any agent or other person having the right to practice before the EPO 
during the European phase is entitled to practice before the EPO as IPEA 
in respect of that application. The same applies to any agent or other 
person entitled to practice before the RO with which the international 
application was filed (Article 49 PCT) (see GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.1).

Where an agent is appointed, any correspondence intended for the 
applicant will be sent to the address indicated for the agent.

If there are two or more applicants and no common agent or common 
representative is appointed, all correspondence will be sent to the 
first-named applicant who has the right to file an international application 
with the receiving Office concerned, as this applicant will be considered to 
be the common representative ("deemed common representative") (see 
GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII, 1.3).

For common provisions on representation, see GL/PCT-EPO A-VIII.

6.
Election of states

The filing of the demand constitutes the election of all contracting states 
which are designated and are bound by Chapter II of the PCT.

7.
Signature

The demand must be signed either by all the applicants or by the (common) 
agent or the common representative.

8.
Basis for international preliminary examination

The preliminary examination is based on the international application either 
as filed or as amended under Article 19 or 34 (see also GL/PCT-EPO C-III).

Applicants must indicate on which basis they wish the IPEA to start the 
international preliminary examination – the application as originally filed or 
with amendments (Article 19 or Article 34); any translations; any comments 
about the WO-ISA (indexed ISOREPLY) or about the ISR; a sequence 
listing in the language of the IPE where applicable.

Additionally, a fee for preliminary examination and a handling fee are to be 
paid (see GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 7.1 and 7.2).

9.
IPEA file

The EPO as IPEA promptly establishes the file when the conditions under 
Rule 69.1(a) are fulfilled, using the existing ISA file or creating a new file if 
the EPO was not the ISA.

10. Correction of deficiencies
Certain defects might be corrected ex officio by the IPEA; for others, the 
EPO as IPEA invites the applicant to correct the defects within one month 
of the date of the invitation. If the applicant complies with the time limit, the 
demand is deemed to have been received on the actual filing date, 
provided that the demand as submitted sufficiently identified the 
international application. If the applicant does not comply with the invitation 
in due time, the demand is deemed not to have been submitted.

11. Payment and refund of fees
Both the preliminary examination fee and the handling fee must be received 
at the EPO as IPEA one month from the date of receipt of the demand or 
22 months from the earliest priority date, whichever expires later. See 
GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 7.1 and 7.2.

For the conditions for refunding the handling fee and the international 
preliminary 
examination 
fee, 
see 
GL/PCT-EPO A-III, 9.6
and 
9.7, 

respectively.

12. Transmission of demand to the International Bureau
The transmission of the demand to the International Bureau should be 
effected not later than one month after receipt of the demand.

1.
Substitute sheets and rectified sheets

Replacement pages or sheets, filed in response to an invitation by the 
receiving Office to correct defects in the international application, are 
deemed to be part of the international application "as originally filed". These 
sheets are identified with a stamp "SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)" (see 
GL/PCT-EPO H-IV, 1). Also, replacement pages or sheets for rectification 
of obvious mistakes under Rule 91 are deemed to be part of the 
international application "as originally filed". These sheets are identified 
with "RECTIFIED SHEET (RULE 91.1)" (see GL/PCT-EPO H-IV, 2.2).

See GL/PCT-EPO H-IV, 2, for the procedure to follow if the rectified sheets 
contain added subject-matter.

2.
Sheets filed under Rule 20.6 containing missing parts or elements 

or correct parts or elements
If applicants omit to file part(s) of the application and/or (an) entire 
element(s) thereof (i.e. all of the description and/or all of the claims), they 
may still furnish it (them) at a later date without affecting the international 
filing date, subject to the requirements of Rules 4.18 and 20.6(a) and 
provided the missing part(s) and/or element(s) were completely contained 
in the priority document.

Similarly, if applicants appear to have erroneously filed (a) part(s) of the 
application and/or (an) entire element(s) thereof (i.e. all of the description 
and/or all of the claims), they may still furnish the correct part(s) and/or 
element(s) at a later date without affecting the international filing date, 
subject to the requirements of Rules 4.18 and 20.6(a) and provided the 
correct part(s) and/or element(s) were completely contained in the priority 
document.

Such elements and/or parts are then considered to have been part of the 
application as originally filed, provided that they were notified to the ISA on 
time or the relevant additional fee was paid; see GL/PCT-EPO B-III, 2.3.3, 
B-III, 2.3.4, and B-XI, 2.1.

The examiner checks whether the RO's assessment of the "completely 
contained" criterion was correct (see GL/PCT-EPO H-II, 2.2.2).

See also GL/PCT-EPO H-II, 2.2.2.2, for the impact on the IPER.

See also GL/EPO C-III, 1.3, and GL/EPO E-IX, 2.9.4, for the effect on the 
European phase.

amendment must be taken into consideration for the purpose of the 
international preliminary examination.

See GL/PCT-EPO H-II and H-III for details.

4.
Added subject-matter

All amended pages (description, claims, drawings) must be examined to 
see whether they introduce subject-matter not originally disclosed. The 
same criteria should be used as under Art. 123(2) EPC for the European 
procedure (see GL/PCT-EPO H-II and III).

Concerning the applicant's obligation to indicate the basis for the 
amendments in the application as originally filed, see GL/PCT-EPO H-I, 6.

If any newly filed claim, drawing or part of the description contains 
amendments which are considered to go beyond the disclosure as 
originally filed, the claim concerned is examined, taking into consideration 
only those technical features which have a basis in the application as 
originally filed, disregarding the amendments which are considered as 
introducing added subject-matter.

If that is not possible, the text of the claims as originally filed or amended 
under Art. 19(1) is examined and this information is entered on the cover 
sheet and in Section I of the WO-IPEA (Form 408) and/or of the IPER 
(Form 409). On the separate sheet, reasons must be given as to why the 
amendments introduce subject-matter not originally disclosed and why they 
are disregarded.

Chapter IV – Examination of the WO-ISA and 
replies

1.
General procedure

Under Chapter II, the reply to the WO-ISA, WO-IPEA (Form 408) or 
telephone minutes with possible amendments will be examined.

The final result of this examination under Chapter II is the issuance of the 
IPER (see GL/PCT-EPO C-VIII).

The examiner will first consider whether the objections raised in the 
WO-ISA have been overcome by the submitted arguments and/or 
amendments. If this is the case, the IPER will be issued directly, provided 
that the top-up search does not yield any pertinent prior art 
(see GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 5.4). If objections have not been overcome or if 
pertinent prior art is found in the top-up search (see GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 5.3
and 5.4), a further WO-IPEA or telephone minutes should be issued as set 
out in GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 2.2.

If a further WO-IPEA or telephone minutes setting a time limit for reply are 
issued, the examiner will examine any reply from the applicant and will then 
as a rule draft the IPER directly even if objections still occur, unless there is 
an 
outstanding 
request 
for 
a 
telephone 
consultation 

(see GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 2.2, and C-VII, 1). An exception could be if it is 
clear that minor amendments could be suggested during e.g. a short 
telephone consultation which would result in a positive IPER, so that it 
would appear procedurally expedient to solve these problems in the 
Chapter II phase.

2.
Despatch of a further written opinion (Form 408)

2.1
Procedure when the EPO was not the ISA

Where the ISR and WO-ISA were established by another European 
International Searching Authority (at present SE, ES, AT, FI, TR, NPI (XN) 
and VPI (XV)), the WO-ISA is not considered as the first written opinion for 
the procedure under Chapter II PCT and the examiner will examine the file, 
taking into account the WO-ISA and any reply from the applicant on file. If 
there are objections as to novelty, inventive step and/or industrial 
applicability, the examiner will send a WO-IPEA with a time limit for the 
applicant to reply as laid down in Rule 66.2(d), which is normally 
two months.

If, despite the applicant's timely and substantive reply (in the form of 
amendments and/or arguments) to this WO-IPEA, there are still objections 
outstanding, possibly resulting from the top-up search in Chapter II
(see GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 5), a further written opinion or telephone minutes 
are issued as set out under GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 2.2.

2.2
Procedure when the EPO was the ISA

Applicants must be given a further opportunity for interaction in Chapter II
before a negative IPER is established, on condition that they have filed in 

OJ EPO 2011, 532

Rule 66.1bis
GL/ISPE 3.19

OJ EPO 2011, 532


Part C – Chapter IV-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

due time a substantive reply to the WO-ISA in the form of amendments 
and/or arguments.

Thus if, after reply to the WO-ISA, there are still objections outstanding, 
before issuing a negative IPER the examiner must send:

–
as a rule, a (further) written opinion (Form 408, WO-IPEA), but:

–
if a request for a telephone consultation was filed before the (further) 
written opinion was issued: telephone minutes;

–
if a request for either a telephone consultation or a (further) written 
opinion (see GL/PCT-EPO C-VII, 1) was filed before the (further) 
written opinion was issued: a written opinion or telephone minutes,

in either case generally (see GL/PCT-EPO C-VII, 1) with a time limit to 
reply which is normally two months, in order to give the applicant a further 
opportunity to provide arguments and/or amendments in reply to any 
outstanding objections. Documents newly found during the top-up search 
(see GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 5) are attached to the WO-IPEA or to the 
telephone minutes, as appropriate.

If the applicant has not submitted any response to the negative WO-ISA 
with the demand, and the top-up search in Chapter II does not reveal any 
new pertinent prior art, then a negative IPER, repeating the objections 
raised in the WO-ISA, will be issued directly.

In the exceptional situation of a non-unitary application, where all inventions 
examined were found novel and inventive, but still lacking unity as the only 
remaining objection, a negative IPER can be sent directly without a further 
WO-IPEA (see GL/PCT-EPO C-VIII, 3).

2.3
Supplementary international search (SIS) by another office

When conducting preliminary examination under Chapter II, the examiner 
must also take into account any documents cited in any supplementary 
international search report (SISR) by another office which is available in the 
file.

If the SISR has not been received by the EPO 24 months after the priority 
date, the file will be sent to the examiner anyway. If, after checking, the 
examiner concludes that an invitation to pay additional fees in case of lack 
of 
unity 
(see 
GL/PCT-EPO C-V, 1) 
or 
a 
WO-IPEA 
(see 

GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 2.2) has to be sent, this will happen as soon as 
possible without awaiting the SISR.

If neither an invitation to pay additional fees in case of lack of unity nor a 
WO-IPEA needs to be sent out before the IPER is established, the 
examiner waits until 27 months from the priority date to establish the IPER 
to allow the SISR to arrive and be taken into account.

If the IPER has not yet been established, the examiner will take the SISR 
into account when establishing the IPER.

Rule 66.2(d)

Rule 45bis.8(c)


March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part C – Chapter IV-3

2.4
Files arriving late

If the demand has been validly received by the EPO very late, the examiner 
will telephone the applicant and explain the situation. In such cases 
applicants will then be asked whether they prefer to:

–
discuss the application over the phone and receive a short time limit 
to file amendments (e.g. one to two weeks, set by the telephone 
minutes); or

–
receive a WO-IPEA with a short time limit (e.g. one to two weeks); or

–
receive a negative IPER without further interaction; or

–
receive a WO-IPEA with a longer time limit, in which case the IPER 
will be issued late.

In those very exceptional cases where the file is so late that even with a 
time limit of one to two weeks the IPER would be issued after 28 months, 
applicants will be asked whether they would like a time limit to file 
amendments although the IPER will be late or prefer a timely but negative 
IPER without further interaction.

In the above-mentioned exceptional cases where after a telephone 
consultation the applicant does not wish to file amendments/observations 
but agrees that a negative IPER can be established directly, the examiner 
will send a direct negative IPER.

2.5
Request for a further written opinion

Frequently applicants explicitly request a further written opinion (under 
Chapter II) if the examiner's opinion is still negative. If the applicant has not 
yet had a further opportunity to file amendments in Chapter II, this request 
must be granted (see GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 2.2).

If the applicant has already had a further opportunity to file amendments, 
then as a rule the IPER is issued directly (see however also 
GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 1).

3.
Late-filed reply after a first or further WO-IPEA (408) has been sent

In the PCT procedure, there is no loss of right for applicants if they do not 
meet the time limits for replying to a written opinion. The only risk the 
applicant takes with a late reply is that it might not be taken into account for 
establishing the IPER.

In practice, if the applicant's reply is received after the time limit set in the 
WO-IPEA (Form 408) but before an IPER (Form 409) has been started, the 
late-filed reply is taken into consideration for drawing up the IPER.

If a reply is received after the IPER has actually been started and the 
applicant has not met all the objections set out in the last written opinion, 

Rule 66.4bis
Rule 80.5
Rule 82
Rule 82quater
GL/ISPE 19.32
GL/ISPE 19.50

GL/ISPE 19.33


Part C – Chapter IV-4
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

the late reply is not considered and the IPER is drawn up on the basis of 
the conclusions set out in the last WO-IPEA.

If a reply is received after the IPER has actually been started and all the 
objections set out in the last WO-IPEA have been met, the late-filed reply is 
taken into consideration for drawing up the IPER.

If no reply has been received, the IPER is drawn up on the basis of the 
conclusions set out in the last WO-IPEA.

4.
Consequences of a restriction of the search

4.1
Submissions prompted by a restriction of the search or a 

declaration that no search is possible
If the search covered only some claims or part of one or more claims (see 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII), only the subject-matter which has been searched - as 
indicated in the ISR (GL/PCT-EPO B-X, 8) and/or in the WO-ISA 
(GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 6) - can be the object of the international preliminary 
examination. It should always be made clear which claims have been 
examined.

After a restriction of the search, either because subject-matter is excluded 
from the search or because a meaningful search is not possible, or after a 
declaration that no search at all is possible, the applicant's reply may, at 
subsequent stages of the procedure, challenge the ISA's findings.

However, the IPEA has no responsibility for actions taken by the ISA, and 
there is no provision in the PCT for an IPEA review of, or for an appeal 
against, such an ISA decision.

Any written arguments from the applicant relating to the completeness of 
the search are not to be treated as a communication with the IPEA, unless 
the applicant's reply contains a complaint against the findings at the search 
stage when the EPO acted as ISA (see GL/PCT-EPO C-IX, 4).

If the reply to the WO-ISA contains arguments challenging the findings at 
the search stage related to the restriction of the search, the examiner will 
mention in the WO-IPEA or IPER (under Section III) that the findings of the 
ISA cannot be reviewed by the IPEA.

If the applicant phones the examiner to discuss the issue orally, the 
examiner will inform the applicant that this is a matter which is the 
responsibility of the ISA under Chapter I of the PCT and that the procedure 
before the ISA is closed.

If the reply contains amended claims introducing unsearched matter, the 
applicant will be informed in the IPER (under Section III) that an opinion 
cannot be given for unsearched matter.

As explained in GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 1, an additional search may be made 
after entry into the European phase, in the examination phase, if the 
reasons for restricting the search can be overcome (see also

Rule 66.1(e)

Art. 17(2)(a)(i) and (ii)

Rule 66.1(e)


March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part C – Chapter IV-5

GL/EPO C-IV, 7.3). This additional search is at no additional cost to the 
applicant.

4.2
Consequences of a declaration of no search or an incomplete 

search in subsequent European procedure
For unsearched subject-matter, no written opinion is established under PCT 
Chapter I and no examination is carried out under PCT Chapter II. 
Furthermore, there is no possibility to appeal the decision of the ISA (see 
GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 4.1), so that even if the applicant were to succeed in 
convincing the examiner under Chapter II that the decision not to search 
certain subject-matter was incorrect, this has no consequences. However, 
in the European procedure the examining division must review the decision 
of the search division (examiner) and take a final decision. This implies that 
in the European phase for the Euro-PCT application the examiner might 
have to reverse the decision of the ISA and perform a complete search 
(either because of the arguments filed or because of the claims having 
been redrafted so that a search can now be performed, see also
GL/EPO C-IV, 7.3).

5.
Top-up searches in PCT Chapter II

A top-up search is mandatory at the outset of PCT Chapter II, subject to 
some exceptions (see GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 5.2). The date – or absence – of 
this top-up search must be indicated in the IPER.

5.1
Timing, basis and forms

The top-up search will be conducted before/at the same time as issuing the 
first WO-IPEA (Form 408)/telephone consultation or, where no written 
opinion is produced, the IPER (Form 409) (approximately within a month of 
the start of international preliminary examination). A further top-up search 
before issuance of the IPER is normally not necessary.

In the case of non-unity where there is more than one invention claimed for 
which examination under Chapter II is demanded, the examiner will first 
issue an invitation to pay additional examination fees (Form 405) and then 
perform the top-up search for all inventions for which additional 
examination fees have been paid.

The IPEA must indicate in the IPER whether or not a top-up search has 
been done. The date indicated in the form is the date of the latest top-up 
search. The box which indicates that no top-up search has been done is 
only ticked if all the claims are exempted from top-up search.

5.2
Exemptions from top-up search

As a general rule, a top-up search will be conducted for all the claims 
forming the basis for the Chapter II examination, as indicated in boxes I and 
III of the WO/IPER.

A top-up search is not conducted on:

(a)
subject-matter not searched by the ISA;

(b)
non-unity cases – inventions for which additional search fees were 
paid, but not additional examination fees;

(c)
subject-matter which, although not excluded from the search, is 
excluded from preliminary examination;

In addition to what is mentioned in Rule 66.1ter PCT, the top-up search 
may be refused or limited by the EPO as IPEA:

(d)
where amendments contain added matter;

(e)
where there is no letter explaining the basis for amendments and/or 
indicating what has been amended in the application;

(f)
where the EPO as ISA would not cite any documentary evidence as 
to the relevant state of the art (e.g. in case of "notorious knowledge" 
in the field of computer-implemented inventions).

In case (d) above, the examiner will perform the top-up search based on 
either the previous set of application documents or the amended set, 
ignoring the added subject-matter. In case (e) above, the same applies to 
unsupported amendments (see GL/PCT-EPO C-III, 4).

Where a top-up search is made for some claims or part of claims, there is 
no indication of:

–
which claims are not covered by the top-up search (this should be 
derivable from the indications in Sections I and III of the WO/IPER); 
or

–
why no or only a partial top-up search has been made.

5.3
Documents newly found in the top-up search, when further 

objections are present
If the top-up search reveals pertinent prior art, according to present practice 
a WO-IPEA or a telephone consultation is the first action in Chapter II 
(see GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 2.2). If a positive WO-ISA was drafted or the 
objections in the negative WO-ISA have been overcome by the applicant's 
amendments/arguments, see GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 5.4.

The documents found are indicated as follows:

(a)
If the newly found documents are published after the filing date 
(E documents) and are relevant for novelty, they are mentioned in 
Section VI of the WO-IPEA and IPER (for the level of detail see 
GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 4.3).

(b)
If the newly found documents are published before the priority date 
and are relevant for novelty and/or inventive step, they are 
mentioned in Section V of the WO-IPEA and IPER and detailed 
reasoning is provided.

If the newly found documents are published in the priority period 
(P documents) and are relevant for novelty and/or inventive step, and 
if the priority is (assumed to be) valid, the documents are mentioned 
in Section VI of the WO-IPEA and IPER; comments are optional (see 
GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 4.2). This applies only if there are other 
objections; otherwise, see GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 5.4.

(d)
If the newly found documents are published in the priority period 
(P documents) and are relevant for novelty and/or inventive step, and 
if the priority is invalid, the documents are mentioned in Section V of 
the WO-IPEA and IPER and detailed reasoning is provided.

Documents found during the top-up search and mentioned in the WO-IPEA 
will also be mentioned in the IPER, unless rendered irrelevant by 
amendments or arguments provided by the applicant during the 
international preliminary examination. It will be always indicated in Box I of 
the IPER that additional relevant documents were found during the top-up 
search.

5.4
Intended positive IPER and top-up search

If a positive WO-ISA was drafted or the objections in the negative WO-ISA 
have been overcome by the applicant's amendments/arguments, and if the 
top-up search reveals:

(a)
no relevant documents, a positive IPER is issued directly.

(b)
pertinent prior art published before the priority date, a WO-IPEA or 
telephone minutes is/are issued (GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 2.2). Details of 
how 
the 
document 
is 
indicated 
can 
be 
found 
in 

GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 5.3(b).

(c)
only P/E documents which are (could become) prior art under 
Art. 54(3) EPC in later EP proceedings (independently of the validity 
of the priority), a WO-IPEA with detailed novelty reasoning is sent 
(GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 3.4); the document is introduced in Section VI 
and its possible relevance upon entry into the EP phase is indicated. 
Details of how the document is indicated can be
found in 

GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 5.3(a).

(d)
other P/E documents relevant for novelty and if the priority is 
(assumed to be) valid, 
a positive IPER is sent directly 

(GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 3.4), and the document is mentioned in 
Section VI of the IPER.

Rule 64.1



March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part C – Chapter V-1

Chapter V – Unity of invention

1.
Unity of invention under Chapter II

If an invitation to pay additional fees was issued during Chapter I and the 
applicant paid some or all of the required additional fees, and if, where 
applicable, the objection as to lack of unity was at least partly upheld during 
a protest procedure, then under Chapter II the applicant will normally be 
invited (using Form 405) to pay additional examination fees if all the 
searched inventions are also to be examined under Chapter II. Inventions 
for which no search fees were paid cannot be pursued and will thus also 
not be objected to or commented on. A review of the decision taken under 
Chapter I is not provided for in the PCT.

A single WO-IPEA/IPER is then drafted by the examiner, dealing with all 
the inventions for which examination fees have been paid.

In reply to the WO-ISA the applicant may have filed redrafted claims which 
differ substantially from those for which lack of unity was raised. In such a 
case it should be carefully considered whether:

–
the lack of unity objection still applies to the new set of claims

–
the amended claims relate to searched subject-matter

–
the reasoning as to lack of unity has to be amended because of the 
new claims and/or the arguments presented.

Normally, the examiner under Chapter II agrees with the objection made at 
the search stage. Exceptionally, if this is not the case (e.g. if the search and 
WO-ISA were made by another office), it is possible to send out an 
invitation to pay further examination fees (Form 405) even if this was not 
done at the search stage. However, if a lack of unity objection was raised at 
the search stage resulting in a partial search and a different conclusion is 
reached under Chapter II, there is no possibility to ask for an additional 
search for unsearched subject-matter. In this case, examination in 
Chapter II is restricted to what has been searched.

Furthermore, it is possible that the original claims did not lack unity but the 
amended claims do. In such a case, if the amended claims lacking unity 
relate to unsearched subject-matter, they are not examined, and a 
WO-IPEA/IPER is established on searched subject-matter only (no 
Form 405 is to be sent out). It is also possible that the amended claims do 
not lack unity, but that these amended claims relate to subject-matter 
lacking unity with the originally searched invention or group of inventions. In 
such a case, the applicant is informed that the amended claims will not be 
examined in a WO-IPEA/IPER (no Form 405 is sent out). On the other 
hand, if e.g. the applicant has generalised the original independent claim so 
that it is no longer novel and lack of unity a posteriori occurs, then an 
invitation to pay additional fees is sent before the WO-IPEA/IPER.

Part C – Chapter V-2

March 2024

For information on the exceptional situation of a non-unitary application, 
where all inventions examined were found novel and inventive, but still 
lacking unity as the only remaining objection, see GL/PCT-EPO C-VIII, 3.

2.
No payment of additional search fees

If, in reply to the objection to lack of unity at the search stage, the applicant 
has not paid additional search fees, the WO-IPEA/IPER is based on the 
claims for which the search report and the WO-ISA have been drafted, 
taking amendments and arguments from the applicant into account. Section 
IV is not filled out.

3.
Searched claims did not comply with unity of invention

3.1
Payment of additional search fees without protest

If, in reply to the objection to lack of unity at the search stage, the applicant 
has paid additional search fees without protest, and the application still 
lacks unity, the objection indicated on Form 206 and in the WO-ISA will 
normally 
be 
confirmed, 
where 
necessary 
adapted 
to 
the 

amendments/arguments filed by the applicant.

Form 405 is sent out, requesting additional examination fees only for those 
inventions which have been searched and which are still present in the 
claims.

3.2
Payment of additional search fees under protest

If, in reply to the objection to lack of unity at the search stage, the applicant 
has paid additional search fees under protest and

(a)
the Review Panel decided that the protest was fully justified, no 
invitation to pay additional fees (Form 405) is sent. The Review 
Panel's decision is followed and the WO-IPEA/IPER is established 
for all searched inventions;

(b)
the Review Panel decided that the protest was partly justified, an 
invitation to pay additional fees (Form 405) is sent, with the 
reasoning and the number of inventions adapted to the Review 
Panel's decision.

The examiner should ensure that the lack of unity objection raised at the 
search stage is still valid for the newly filed claims.

3.3
No request for payment of additional search fees

If, at the search stage, an objection of lack of unity was raised but 
exceptionally it was chosen not to request the applicant to pay additional 
search fees, the examination is carried out on the entire application. No 
invitation to pay additional fees (Form 405) is sent; instead, the 
WO-IPEA/IPER is established for all searched inventions. Under 
Section IV, it is indicated that the requirement of unity is not fulfilled.

4.
Applicant's reply to the invitation to pay additional fees 

(Form 405)

4.1
No payment of additional examination fees or failure to reply

If, in reply to the invitation in Form 405, the applicant neither restricts the 
claims nor pays additional examination fees, or if the applicant does not 
reply, the WO-IPEA/IPER is established on the basis of the main or first 
invention mentioned in the invitation to pay additional fees (Form 405) and 
for which the search fee has been paid. Section IV is filled out and the 
reasons for lack of unity are given on the separate sheet.

If, in reply to the invitation in Form 405, the applicant restricted the claims, 
the examiner has to check whether the restricted set of claims is unitary 
and whether all claims relate to searched subject-matter.

If this is the case, the WO-IPEA/IPER is established on the restricted set of 
claims, and Section IV is not filled out.

If this is not the case, the WO-IPEA/IPER is established on the main or first 
invention mentioned in Form 405 and for which the search fee has been 
paid; Section IV is filled out, and any claims relating to non-searched 
subject-matter are indicated in Section III.

4.2
Payment of additional examination fees without protest

If, in reply to the invitation in Form 405, the applicant pays additional 
preliminary examination fees without protest, the WO-IPEA/IPER is 
established on the basis of those inventions for which examination fees 
have been paid. Section IV is filled out and the reasons for lack of unity are 
given on the separate sheet.

If, in reply to the invitation in Form 405, the applicant restricted the claims 
and paid additional fees, the examiner has to verify that the restricted set of 
claims does not contain more inventions than those for which additional 
fees have been paid and that the restricted claims relate to subject-matter 
that has been searched.

If this is the case, the WO-IPEA/IPER is established on the restricted set of 
claims, and Section IV is filled out.

If this is not the case, the WO-IPEA/IPER is established on as many 
inventions mentioned in Form 405 as additional fees have been paid for. 
Section IV is filled out and any claims relating to unsearched subject-matter 
are indicated in Section III.

In both cases the reasons for the lack of unity are given on the separate 
sheet.

4.3
Payment of additional examination fees under protest

In reply to Form 405, applicants may pay some or all of the additional fees 
under protest. If they do so, then this triggers the protest procedure for 
determining whether the request for payment of the additional fees was 
justified (see also GL/PCT-EPO C-V, 5).

5.
Protest procedure

The protest procedure consists of a review within the IPEA first by the 
formalities officer and then by a Review Panel.

5.1
Admissibility of the protest as checked by the formalities officer

Before initiating the protest procedure the formal admissibility of the protest 
in the sense of Rule 68.3(c) (Chapter II) must be checked.

To be admissible the protest should satisfy the following requirements:

(a)
The applicant must have paid the prescribed protest fee 
(Rule 68.3(e)), and

(b)
The payment under protest must be accompanied by a reasoned 
statement, i.e. the reasoned statement should have been filed with 
the payment or at the latest within the time limit set in Form 405 
(Chapter II).

The reasoned statement must comply with Rule 68.3(c); i.e. applicants 
should argue why the international application complies with the 
requirement of unity of invention or why the amount of the required 
additional fee is excessive. In the protest applicants should question the 
number of additional examination fees that they have been invited to pay, 
and not the amount of a single additional fee.

The payment of the protest fee and the filing of a purported reasoned 
statement are assessed by specially trained formalities officers. If the 
formalities officer finds any deficiencies, the applicant is informed of them 
by way of Form 420 or Form 424. Any substantive analysis is made by the 
Review Panel when assessing the justification of the protest.

5.2
The work of the Review Panel

For 
the 
composition 
and 
purpose 
of 
the 
Review 
Panel, 
see 

GL/PCT-EPO B-VII, 7.2. The names of the members of the Review Panel 
are made public on Form 420.

The scope of the review is limited to those inventions for which additional 
fees have been paid. If the applicant's reasoning is not related to those 
inventions, the Review Panel will come to the conclusion that the protest is 
not or is only partially justified, depending on the case.

If the Review Panel determines that the protest is wholly justified, it will 
inform the applicant with Form 420 (Decision on Protest Chapter II). This 
also applies if the Review Panel's finding results in the application not 
lacking unity. It is not necessary to give any reasoning unless the Review 
Panel decides that such reasoning would be beneficial. Furthermore, the 
Review Panel will order the reimbursement of all the additional fees and the 
protest fee. The examination will be carried out on the inventions for which 
the fees are paid, and the non-unity reasoning and the number of 
inventions in the IPER (or WO-IPEA) will be adapted to the Review Panel's 
decision.

If the Review Panel considers that the protest is not justified at all, it will 
communicate this to the applicant using Form 420. Reasoning must be 
given, indicating why the request for payment of additional fees is upheld 
and addressing the applicant's relevant arguments. The examination will be 
carried out on the inventions for which the fees are paid.

If the Review Panel considers that the protest is only partially justified, it will 
communicate this to the applicant using Form 420. Reasoning must be 
given, indicating why the request for payment of the additional fees is 
partially upheld and addressing the applicant's relevant arguments. The 
examination will be carried out on the inventions for which the fees are 
paid, and the non-unity reasoning and the number of inventions in the IPER 
(or WO-IPEA) will be adapted to the Review Panel's decision. The Review 
Panel will order the reimbursement of the corresponding additional fees but 
not the protest fee.

The formalities officer will send the decision of the Review Panel to the 
applicant and the IB. The decision on protest (Form 420) will be sent out 
together with the WO-IPEA or IPER in order to ensure that both are 
consistent.

Chapter VI – Time limits

1.
Start of the international preliminary examination

The EPO as IPEA will start the international preliminary examination when 
it is in possession of all of the documents and fees required under 
Rule 69.1(a). It will not wait until the applicable time limit under 
Rule 54bis.1(a) has expired unless the applicant expressly requests it to do 
so.

Where the statement concerning amendments filed with the demand 
indicates that the applicant would like the international preliminary 
examination to take into account amendments under Article 34 but the 
applicant failed to submit them with the demand, the IPEA will invite it to do 
so within a set time limit, pursuant to Rule 60.1(g) (Form PCT/IPEA/431). 
The IPEA will not start the international preliminary examination until it has 
received them or before expiry of the time limit set in the invitation pursuant 
to Rule 60.1(g), whichever occurs first.

Similarly, where the applicant would like the international preliminary 
examination to take into account amendments under Article 19 and any 
accompanying statements, the IPEA will not start the international 
preliminary examination before it has received a copy of the amendments.

The EPO as IPEA does not apply Rules 69.1(b) and 69.1(b-bis), i.e. it will 
not start the international preliminary examination at the same time as the 
international search.

2.
Time limit for international preliminary examination

The time limit for establishing the international preliminary examination 
report is laid down in Rule 69.2. Where the documents required for the 
preliminary examination were received in due time, the EPO will establish 
the IPER within 28 months from the priority date.

The applicant has a time limit of 31 months from the priority date to enter 
the European phase before the EPO.

3.
Extension of the time limit

Failure to meet the time limit set in the WO-ISA or the WO-IPEA does not 
constitute a formal loss of rights; see GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 3.

Requests for extension of the time limit for replying to the WO-ISA where it 
is considered as a first opinion of the IPEA are handled by the formalities 
officers. As a rule, a one-month extension will be granted if requested 
before expiry of the normal time limit under Rule 54bis and on condition 
that the time limit so extended does not expire later than 25 months from 
the (earliest) priority date; further extensions are not allowed. The extension 
does not apply to the time limit for filing the demand, which cannot be 
extended.

A request for extension of the time limit to reply to a WO-IPEA (Form 408) 
will be granted only if there is sufficient time available to grant the extension

the IPER cannot be met, the request for extension should be granted.

Chapter VII – Other procedures in examination

1.
Request for an interview or telephone consultation

Art. 34(2) gives the applicant the right to communicate orally with the IPEA. 
Thus, a request for a telephone conversation from the applicant or the 
agent (including those overseas) will be granted, but only after the 
subject-matter on which the international preliminary examination is to be 
based has been clarified, i.e. only after the applicant has filed a written 
response to the WO-ISA, or, if the international search report has raised an 
objection of lack of unity, to an invitation to restrict the claims or to pay 
additional fees (Form 405). In that way, the subject-matter to be discussed 
in the telephone conversation is clarified upfront. Requests for personal 
interviews are not granted. However, if a personal interview is requested, 
the examiner should inform the applicant by phone that it is the EPO's 
policy not to grant personal interviews, but that the matter can be discussed 
in the form of a telephone consultation subject to the above condition.

If the applicant has requested a telephone consultation the following 
applies:

(a)
as a general rule the applicant has, upon request, the right to one 
telephone consultation;

(b)
after a telephone consultation the applicant should in general be 
given a time limit (normally two months) to file amended claims 
and/or arguments. If, in a telephone consultation, the applicant has 
expressed the intention not to file further observations/amendments, 
in other words if the applicant has agreed to receive an IPER without 
further interaction, minutes of the telephone consultation are sent 
and these are directly followed up with a negative IPER. No time limit 
is set in the minutes.

(c)
if, before issuance of the (further) written opinion (Form 408), the 
applicant has requested a telephone consultation or alternatively a 
further written opinion, the examiner has the discretion to decide 
which kind of interaction is most suitable for the application in 
question;

(d)
in the specific case of a telephone consultation being requested after 
issuance of the further written opinion but before the date on which 
the IPER is established, the request must be granted before a 
negative IPER is issued. However, in this case the applicant does not 
have the right to file further amendments, unless an agreement has 
been explicitly reached (see below).

When a telephone consultation is arranged, the matters for discussion 
should be clearly stated in advance. If the arrangement is made by 
telephone, the examiner should record the particulars and briefly indicate in 
the file (Form 428: minutes of telephone conversation) the matters to be 
discussed as well as the date and time for the consultation. A copy of the 
arrangements recorded is sent to the applicant.

Part C – Chapter VII-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

If the applicant wishes to discuss amended claims during a telephone 
consultation, a copy of such claims should be sent in advance to the 
examiner in order to enable appropriate preparation. The time limit for such 
submissions will be set by the examiner on the record of the arrangement.

The result of the telephone consultation is recorded by the examiner and 
added to the file. The recording will depend upon the nature of the matters 
under discussion and will be forwarded to the applicant.

If the consultation replaces the second written opinion or takes place after a 
reply to a second written opinion but has ended with an agreement on
amendments, Form 428 will include:

–
a warning that the amendments cannot be made by the IPEA and

–
an invitation for the applicant to file amended sheets normally within 
one month, but at least one month before the deadline for the IPER 
(unless as agreed with respect to the late issue of the IPER).

In those cases where the consultation takes place after a reply to a second 
written opinion and no agreement has been reached, applicants are 
informed that their arguments will be taken into account when establishing 
the IPER.

Enquiries as to the processing of files may be filed online using the 
dedicated form (EPO Form 1012) (see the Notice from the EPO dated 
2 August 2016, OJ EPO 2016, A66).

2.
Confidentiality

Without the applicant's authorisation, the IB and the EPO as IPEA may not 
allow access to the file of the international preliminary examination by third 
parties, except by the elected Offices once the IPER has been established.

Once the IPER has been established and transmitted to the IB, the latter 
sends a copy of the IPER, together with its translation (as prescribed) and 
its annexes (in the original language), to each elected Office. As from that 
time, the IB, on behalf of the EPO as elected Office, also furnishes copies 
of the IPER as well as of any document transmitted to it under Rule 71.1 by 
the IPEA to anyone who requests them.

Once the IPER has been established, at the request of any elected Office, 
the EPO as IPEA will provide access to any document contained in its file, 
except to any information in respect of which it has been notified by the IB 
that the information has been omitted from publication in accordance with 
Rule 48.2(l) or from public access in accordance with Rule 94.1(d) or (e).

Provided international publication has taken place, once the IPER has been 
established, third parties may access the file of the international preliminary 
examination via those elected Offices whose national law allows access by 
third parties to the file of a national application (see also GL/EPO 
E-IX, 2.10). Such access may be allowed to the same extent as provided 
by the national law for access to the file of a national application.

3.
Examination of observations by third parties

For details on third-party observations please refer to GL/PCT-EPO E-II.

For relevant third-party observations in Chapter II the following applies:

(a)
If a negative IPER is envisaged and a second written opinion has not 
been sent, a WO-IPEA (Form 408) is drafted taking into account the 
third-party observations and the applicant's comments where 
available, and referring to the new prior-art documents in section V 
(see also GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 2.2).

(b)
If the IPER would have been negative even without the third-party 
observations and a WO-IPEA has already been sent before receipt of 
these observations, no further written opinion is sent before 
establishment of the IPER.

(c)
If a WO-IPEA has already been sent before receipt of the third-party 
observations and the IPER would have been positive without the 
third-party observations, a new WO-IPEA is issued or the applicant is 
called, whichever course of action is considered the more expedient, 
in particular in the light of the deadline for issuing the IPER.

In cases (b) and (c) above, the IPER is established taking into account the 
third-party observations and the applicant's comments, and referring to the 
new documents where appropriate in Section V of the IPER.

(d)
If a positive IPER is envisaged since, even though the third-party 
observations may refer to more relevant documents than the ones on 
file, they do not prejudice novelty and inventive step, the newly cited 
relevant documents are dealt with in the reasons in favour of 
patentability in Section V on the separate sheet as appropriate.

If the documents are relevant but do not add anything to what was 
already available, it is left to the examiner's discretion whether they 
need to be quoted in the IPER. For example, in those cases where 
the documents are a better starting point for the problem-solution 
approach, examiners may wish to review their argumentation in 
support of the positive assessment of inventive step.

Third-party observations which are not relevant or not sufficiently 
understandable (see GL/PCT-EPO E-II for observations not in an EPO 
official language) do not need to be dealt with substantially in the WO-IPEA 
and/or in the IPER. A comment is included in Section V of the WO-IPEA 
and/or in the IPER indicating that the third-party observations have been 
taken into account and found not to be relevant or that the third-party 
observations could not be taken into account and why.

March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part C – Chapter VIII-1

Chapter VIII – The IPER

1.
Opinion given in the IPER (Form 409)

Art. 35(2) specifies that the report shall not contain any statement on the 
question of whether the claimed invention is or seems to be patentable or 
unpatentable according to any national law. Moreover, the purpose of the 
preliminary examination is merely to give an opinion, but it does not lead to 
a grant or a refusal of the application. In these circumstances, therefore, 
the report should not give the impression that any part of the application 
may or may not be allowable. It will only state whether or not the claims 
meet certain criteria.

2.
Completing the IPER

The IPER is drafted in the same way as the WO-ISA, i.e. a positive or 
negative opinion will be given for all claims, taking into account the 
arguments and/or amendments submitted by the applicant.

Therefore, the same criteria apply to the IPER as to the WO-ISA with 
respect to all examination issues (see also GL/PCT-EPO B-XI).

In particular the IPER will only be established for claims which have been 
searched (as indicated in the WO-ISA); any amended claims that are 
directed to subject-matter not searched will not be considered and an 
indication will be made in Section III of the IPER (non-establishment of 
opinion), with reasons given on the separate sheet.

If no reply has been received to a written opinion or the objections raised in 
a previous written opinion are still valid, the comments contained in that 
written opinion can be transferred to the corresponding section in the IPER. 
However, if the applicant has submitted arguments in favour of the claims, 
then even if the objections previously raised are still valid, the examiner 
should, in a neutral way (i.e. without direct reference to the letter of reply in 
the sense of "see reply/arguments from the applicant"), deal with at least 
the main arguments from the applicant in order to ensure that the applicant 
knows that the arguments made have been considered.

If arguments, facts and evidence, such as the results of a comparative test, 
produced by an applicant in response to a written opinion are of crucial 
importance in assessing inventive step, the examiner may base the 
argumentation in the IPER on the applicant's response. This is of 
importance to other offices which need to know why a particular conclusion 
has been reached. However, since the IPER should be written in a neutral 
way and should be self-contained, the examiner should not append to the 
IPER portions of the applicant's reply or refer directly to the applicant's 
letter of reply.

Part C – Chapter VIII-2

2.1
Sequence listings

Where no (complete) international search was carried out because the 
applicant did not file an electronic sequence listing conforming to WIPO 
Standard ST.26 in response to a request from the ISA or did not pay the 
late furnishing fee, the IPER will indicate under Section III that the 
examination is limited according to Rule 13ter.2 to the same extent as the 
search was limited because the applicant failed to comply with Rule 5.2 (no 
sequence listing) and/or Rule 13ter.1(a) (no computer-readable sequence 
listing). The examiner also indicates in Section III of the IPER that the 
examination is also limited according to Rule 66.1(e) because the search 
was incomplete.

Where a sequence listing in electronic form and compliant with WIPO 
Standard ST.26 is not available to the EPO as IPEA, the applicant may be 
invited to furnish such a sequence listing under Rule 13ter.1(a) and to pay 
the late furnishing fee under Rule 13ter.1(c) within a non-extendable period 
of one month from the date of the invitation.

3.
Positive or negative IPER

As for the WO-ISA, the examiner needs to indicate whether the IPER is to 
be considered positive or negative. The same criteria apply as in 
GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 3.4.

In the special case of a non-unitary application, where all inventions 
examined (normally after issuance of an invitation to pay additional fees 
(Form 405); see GL/PCT-EPO C-V, 1) were found novel and inventive, but 
still lacking unity – as the only remaining objection – the IPER is marked as 
negative. Under Section V, a positive statement as to novelty and inventive 
step is given for all examined inventions, and the objection as to lack of 
unity is reasoned under Section IV.

In this special case, the negative IPER can be sent directly without any 
further written opinion, as an exception to the general principle outlined 
in GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 2.2, that prior to issuing a negative IPER a WO-IPEA 
(Form 408) is to be sent. The reason for this exception is that the applicant 
is entitled to have multiple inventions examined in Chapter II if additional 
fees have been paid, so that there is no objection to be raised in the 
WO-IPEA.

In the case of a non-unitary application where no additional search fees 
were paid and the report on the first invention is positive, the IPER is also 
marked as negative (because the non-unity objection will prevent a direct 
grant upon entry into the European phase) and can be sent directly. Under 
Section V, a positive statement as to novelty and inventive step is given for 
the 
first 
invention 
only. 
Section IV 
is 
not 
filled 
out 

(see GL/PCT-EPO C-V, 2).

4.
Rectification of the IPER

Since an IPER is a non-binding opinion and not a decision, the PCT 
provides for neither opposition nor appeal against it. Establishment of the 
IPER is normally the end of the international phase. Any further

observations or amendments the applicant wishes to make should 
therefore be addressed to the elected Offices and not to the IPEA.

Only when there is an error in the IPER or the IPER has been issued when 
in fact a second written opinion should have been issued (see 
GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 2.2) will the file be transmitted to the examiner to 
decide whether or not to issue a corrected IPER.

In rare cases, the report may be incorrect, for example because it was
based on wrong application documents or citations which are wrongly cited 
or are not comprised in the state of the art or on new documents cited for 
the first time in the IPER, or because amendments to the claims were 
overlooked.

In such cases, if there is at least one week before the actual deadline 
(normally 28 months from the priority date), a new Form 409 is completed 
with the correct information, and the corrected IPER is sent to the applicant 
and to WIPO.

In cases where there is less than one week before that deadline, or where 
the deadline has expired, applicants are called to ask whether they still 
wish to receive a corrected IPER. If this is the case, a corrected IPER is 
issued. If the applicant declines to wait for a corrected IPER because of the 
deadline, Form 428 (minutes of telephone consultation) is completed, 
indicating the error in the IPER such that, in the regional phase, the 
applicant may cite the content of this form as evidence, and Form 428 is 
transmitted for information.

If, despite the applicant's request for rectification, the IPER does not 
contain any of the defects mentioned above, the formalities officer informs 
the applicant with a standard letter that the international preliminary 
examination phase has come to an end. Any further comments may only be 
addressed to the elected Offices on entry into the national phase.

Chapter IX – Special requests

1.
Withdrawal of demand under Chapter II

Applicants are entitled to a refund of the whole amount of the international 
preliminary examination fee if the demand is withdrawn before 30 months 
from the priority date and on condition that international preliminary 
examination has not started. If the examiner has actually started to 
examine the file, no refund will be made. The starting date of international 
preliminary examination can in most cases be derived from Form 
PCT/IPEA/409, which in Box I, point 6, indicates the date of the top-up 
search (Rule 70.2(f)). GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 5.1, explains that the top-up 
search is conducted at the start of international preliminary examination 
and is usually not repeated before the IPER is issued.

The withdrawal of the demand will be effective upon receipt of a notice from 
the applicant to the IB. However, the applicant may also submit the notice 
of withdrawal to the EPO as IPEA. In this case, the EPO as IPEA marks the 
date of receipt on the notice and transmits it promptly to the IB. The notice 
is considered to have been submitted to the IB on its date of receipt at the 
EPO as IPEA.

The signature of each applicant is required if the demand under Chapter II
is withdrawn.

2.
Request for examination of a different set of claims

The filing of different sets of claims for different elected States or of 
different (main and auxiliary) requests based on different sets of claims is 
not accepted since examining such claims is both time-consuming and 
against the intention of the PCT. Auxiliary requests are not provided for 
under the PCT because Rule 66.1(c)
provides that, where Art. 19

amendments are made, the international preliminary examination is based 
on these amendments, unless they are superseded or reversed by a later 
amendment under Art. 34, and furthermore because Rule 70.16(a) provides 
for the annexing of the latest set of application documents to the IPER. The 
simultaneous examination of several co-pending requests is not compatible 
with the sequential consideration of single requests provided for in the 
above-mentioned Rules.

If it is clear which request is the preferred (e.g. the main request), the 
WO-IPEA/IPER is established on that request; a remark is added in the 
WO-IPEA/IPER that the treatment of different requests (or main and 
auxiliary requests) is not provided for under the PCT.

If it is not clear which request is preferred (different requests with no 
preferred order), the applicant is asked, preferably by telephone, to furnish 
one set only or to state which set/request should be used for the 
examination.

If the applicant does not reply and/or insists on a plurality of sets, the 
WO-IPEA/IPER is drawn up on the first set, with a remark on the separate 
sheet under Section I.

3.
Request for examination of certain claims only

Applicants sometimes file a request for examination of certain claims only 
without actually restricting the set of claims, e.g. in order to achieve a 
positive IPER although the findings for some claims would be negative. An 
example would be where in reply to the WO-ISA, which contained a 
negative opinion on claims 1-5 and a positive one on claims 6 and 7, the 
applicant does not change the claims but asks that the IPER be established 
for claims 6 and 7 only.

A request for examination of certain claims only is not accepted since the 
IPER is established on the claims on file and can only be restricted by the 
examiner, e.g. on the grounds of lack of unity with not all fees paid, 
unsearched claims, clarity or added subject-matter. A restriction at the 
request of the applicant would be contrary to Art. 35(2), which states that 
the IPER relates to "each claim". In such a case the applicant is informed 
that unless a restricted set of claims is filed the IPER will be established for 
all claims.

4.
Complaint against the findings at the search stage

If the search was restricted and the applicant complains about the findings 
at the search stage, the complaint will be dealt with by the Complaint 
Handling Unit at the EPO.

In order to ensure that a submission is treated as a complaint, applicants 
are advised to use the online complaint form and explicitly state that their 
reply is to be considered as a complaint. A letter of reply in which an 
applicant submits only substantive counterarguments contesting the 
findings of the ISA is not a complaint (see also GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 4.1).

While there is no provision for a review based on substantive arguments, 
the ISA may exceptionally have to issue a corrected ISR in the event of a 
procedural flaw.

Part E – Chapter II-1

Chapter II – Observations by third parties

Third parties may, anonymously if so desired, file observations under the 
PCT which, unlike observations under the EPC, should exclusively refer to 
prior art relevant to the novelty and/or inventive step of the invention 
claimed in the international application. 

The observations are to be submitted electronically to the IB using the 
online tool provided by WIPO between the date of international publication 
and 28 months from the priority date of the international application. They 
may be filed in any language of publication; the cited prior art may be in any 
language. For more details, see the guide entitled "ePCT Third Party 
Observations" published by WIPO. 

The applicant is notified by the International Bureau (IB) of any such 
observations and may file comments within 30 months from the priority 
date.

The IB will promptly communicate any third-party observation and any 
comment by the applicant to the ISA, the SISA and the IPEA, unless the 
(supplementary) international search report or the international preliminary 
examination report (IPER) has already been received by the IB.

Promptly after the expiration of 30 months from the priority date, the third-
party observation(s) and the applicant's comment(s) will be sent to all 
designated Offices and elected Offices. The EPO as designated/elected 
Office will consider a third-party observation filed during the international 
phase after entry into the European phase as to its contents once that 
observation becomes available to it. However, the EPO will only make 
every effort to issue the next office action within three months of expiry of 
the period under Rule 161 EPC on condition that the third party has clearly 
expressed its wish that such action be taken, and that the observation was 
substantiated and not filed anonymously. A third party wishing to achieve 
the above-mentioned result in the European phase should, therefore, make 
this clear in the observation or else file the observation with the EPO as 
designated/elected Office (see also GL/EPO E-VI, 3, last paragraph).

Any third-party observations/comments thereto will be made available for 
public inspection.

If the third-party observations and/or prior art are not in an official EPO 
language, the formalities officer at the EPO will invite the third party to 
submit a translation of the observations and/or the prior art in line with the 
European procedure (GL/EPO E-VI, 3), but setting a shorter time limit 
within the boundaries of the required strict PCT deadlines. No invitation is 
issued if these deadlines cannot be respected or if the third-party 
observations were filed anonymously. 

If the third-party observations and/or prior art are not in an official EPO 
language and a translation is not or cannot be filed, the examiner should 
nevertheless take them into account to the extent that this is feasible, in 
particular when they seem to be prima facie relevant (e.g. from the 

AI 801-805
GL/ISPE 15.68, 16.57
and 17.69

Rule 48.3

Art. 14(1) EPC


Part E – Chapter II-2

drawings of the prior-art documents). The examiner may add a remark in 
the WO-ISA that a translation will be required to allow a detailed 
assessment of the document(s).

Even when third-party observations have been filed, the deadlines 
indicated for issuing the different office actions under the PCT should be 
respected in order to ensure timely issuance of the ISR, SISR or IPER.

For 
third-party 
observations 
received 
during 
Chapter I,

GL/PCT-EPO B-IV, 1.3. For third-party observations received during 
Chapter II, see GL/PCT-EPO C-VII, 3.

Chapter III – Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH)

1.
General

The Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) enables an applicant whose claims 
have been determined to be patentable/allowable to have a corresponding 
application which has been filed with a PPH partner office processed in an 
accelerated manner while at the same time allowing the offices involved to 
exploit available work results.

Currently, the EPO's PPH partner offices are: JPO (Japan), KIPO (South 
Korea), CNIPA (China), USPTO (USA), ILPO (Israel), CIPO (Canada), IMPI 
(Mexico), IPOS (Singapore), IPA (Australia), SIC (Colombia), MyIPO 
(Malaysia), IPOPHL (Philippines), INPI (Brazil), INDECOPI (Peru) and 
(SAIP) Saudi Arabia.

The PPH programmes with Rospatent (Russian Federation) and EAPO 
(Eurasia) have been suspended.

Under the PPH (pilot) programme a PPH request can be based on: 

(i)
the latest PCT work product (WO-ISA or IPRP/IPER) established by 
one of the PPH partner offices as ISA or IPEA (PPH based on PCT 
work products) (except under the PPH (pilot) programme with INPI 
(Brazil)); or 

(ii)
any 
national 
work 
product 
(office 
action 
indicating 

patentable/allowable claims) established during the processing of a 
national application or of a PCT application that has entered the 
national phase before one of the PPH partner offices (PPH based on 
national work products). 

2.
PPH based on a WO-ISA established by the EPO as ISA

Where the EPO is the ISA and the international application contains claims 
that are determined to be patentable/allowable by the EPO as ISA, the 
applicant may under the PPH (pilot) programme request accelerated 
examination at the EPO's PPH partner offices when the application has 
entered the national phase before these offices. The procedures and 
requirements for filing a request with the EPO's PPH partner offices are 
available from their respective websites.

Irrespective of the PPH (pilot) programme, any applicant may request 
accelerated examination under the PACE programme in the procedure 
before the EPO as designated Office at any time. See GL/EPO E-VIII, 4.2.

3.
PPH based on an IPER established by the EPO as IPEA

Under the PPH (pilot) programme, a PPH request can also be based on an 
IPER established by the EPO as IPEA. The procedures and requirements 
for filing a request with the EPO's PPH partner offices are available from 
their respective websites.

Part F – Chapter I-1

Chapter I – Introduction

Apart from the requirements of novelty, inventive step and industrial 
application, and the exclusion of subject-matter for which the ISA and/or 
IPEA is not required to carry out search and international preliminary 
examination, an international application must also satisfy a number of 
other requirements which are checked by the EPO as ISA and/or IPEA and 
reported on in the written opinion and/or IPER, as appropriate. These 
include substantive requirements such as sufficiency of disclosure (Art. 5), 
clarity of the claims (Art. 6) and unity of invention (Rule 13) as well as 
formal requirements such as the numbering of the claims (Rule 6.1) and the 
form of the drawings (Rule 11.10 to 11.13). These requirements are dealt 
with in the present Part F.

Part F also deals with the requirements relating to the right to priority. 

Rule 43bis.1(a)
Rule 66.2(a)



March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part F – Chapter II-1

Chapter II – Content of an international 
application (other than claims)

1.
General

The contents of the international application are set out in Article 3(2). The 
application must contain:

(i)
a request;

(ii)
a description (see GL/PCT-EPO F-II, 4);

(iii)
one or more claims (see GL/PCT-EPO F-IV);

(iv)
one or more drawings (where required; see GL/PCT-EPO F-II, 5); 
and

(v)
an abstract (see GL/PCT-EPO F-II, 2).

This chapter discusses items (ii), (iv) and (v) insofar as they are the 
concern of the ISA and IPEA. Item (v) is dealt with first.

2.
Abstract

2.1
Purpose of the abstract

An international application must contain an abstract. The abstract merely 
serves the purpose of technical information and cannot be taken into 
account for any other purpose, particularly not for the purpose of 
interpreting the scope of the protection sought.

2.2
Definitive content

The abstract is initially supplied by the applicant subject to the exception 
provided for under Rule 38.2. The examiner conducting the main 
international search has the task of determining its definitive content, which 
will normally be published with the application. In doing this, he should 
consider the abstract in relation to the application as filed. If the search 
report is published later than the application, the abstract published with the 
application will be the one resulting from the procedure referred to in ISPE 
Guidelines 15.40.

This procedure does not apply to supplementary international searches for 
which the EPO is SISA, because the main ISA has already provided the 
publication data (see GL/PCT-EPO B-XII, 2).

2.7
Comments on the abstract by the applicant

See ISPE Guidelines 16.45-16.47.

3.
The title

The items making up the request do not normally concern the examiner, 
with the exception of the title. Rule 5.1(a) stipulates that the description 
"shall first state the title of the invention as appearing in the request".

The title must be short and precise. The examiner reviews the title in the 
light of the description and claims and any amendments thereto, to make 
sure that the title, as well as being concise, gives a clear and adequate 
indication of the subject of the invention. Thus, if amendments are made 
which change the categories of claims, the examiner should check whether 
a corresponding amendment, which may not go beyond the disclosure in 
the international application as filed, is needed in the title (see also 
GL/PCT-EPO B-X, 7). See also GL/PCT-EPO H-III, 7.

4.8
Industrial applicability

The description should indicate explicitly the way in which the invention is 
capable of exploitation in industry, if this is not obvious from the description 
or from the nature of the invention (see also GL/PCT-EPO, G-III). The 
expression "capable of exploitation in industry" means the same as 
"susceptible of industrial application". In view of the broad meaning given to 
the latter expression in the Appendix to Chapter 14 of the ISPE Guidelines, 
A14.01[2].1(1) and A14.01[2].2, it is to be expected that, in most cases, the 
way in which the invention can be exploited in industry will be self-evident, 
so that no more explicit description on this point will be required; but there 
may be a few instances, e.g. in relation to methods of testing, where the 
manner of industrial exploitation is not apparent and must therefore be 
explicitly indicated.

Also, in relation to certain biotechnological inventions, i.e. sequences and 
partial sequences of genes, the industrial application is not self-evident and 
must be disclosed in the patent application.

Chapter III – Sufficiency of disclosure

1.
Sufficiency of disclosure

A detailed description of at least one way of carrying out the invention must 
be given. Since the application is addressed to the person skilled in the art, 
it is neither necessary nor desirable that details of well-known ancillary 
features should be given, but the description must disclose any feature 
essential for carrying out the invention in sufficient detail to render it 
apparent to the skilled person how to put the invention into practice. A 
single example may suffice, but where the claims cover a broad field, the 
application should not usually be regarded as satisfying the requirements of 
Art. 5 unless the description gives a number of examples or describes 
alternative embodiments or variations extending over the area protected by 
the claims. However, regard must be had to the facts and evidence of the 
particular case. There are some instances where even a very broad field is 
sufficiently exemplified by a limited number of examples or even one 
example (see also GL/PCT-EPO F-IV, 6.3). In these latter cases the 
application must contain, in addition to the examples, sufficient information 
to allow the person skilled in the art, using common general knowledge, to 
perform the invention over the whole area claimed without undue burden 
and without needing inventive skill. In this context, the "whole area claimed" 
is to be understood as substantially any embodiment falling within the ambit 
of a claim, even though a limited amount of trial and error may be 
permissible, e.g. in an unexplored field or when there are many technical 
difficulties.

With regard to Art. 5, an objection of lack of sufficient disclosure 
presupposes that there are serious doubts, substantiated by verifiable 
facts. See also GL/PCT-EPO F-III, 4.

For the requirements of Art. 5 and of Rule 5.1(a)(iii) and (a)(v) to be fully 
satisfied, it is necessary that the invention is described not only in terms of 
its structure but also in terms of its function unless the functions of the 
various parts are immediately apparent. Indeed in some technical fields 
(e.g. computers), a clear description of function may be much more 
appropriate than an over-detailed description of structure. 

In cases where it is found that an application is sufficiently disclosed 
according to Art. 5 only in respect of a part of the claimed subject-matter, it 
may be appropriate for the examiner to first invite the applicant to provide 
informal 
clarification 
before 
the 
search 
is 
carried 
out 
(see 

GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.3-3.6).

(see GL/PCT-EPO G-III, 1).

4.
Burden of proof as regards the possibility of performing and 

repeating the invention
If there are serious doubts as regards the possibility of performing the 
invention and repeating it as described, the burden of proof as regards this 
possibility, or at least a demonstration that success is credible, rests with 
the applicant, who can discharge this burden of proof during the PCT 
Chapter II procedure or after entry into the European phase before the 
EPO. As regards the possibility of performing and repeating the invention, 
see also GL/PCT-EPO F-III, 3.

5.
Cases of partially insufficient disclosure

5.1
Only variants of the invention are incapable of being performed

Section F-III, 5.1 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis. See also GL/PCT-EPO G-VII, 5.2.

5.2
Absence of well-known details

Reference documents

See ISPE Guidelines 4.26.

Where the reference document relates to the background art, it may be in 
the application as originally filed or introduced at a later date 
(see GL/PCT-EPO F-II, 4.3 and GL/PCT-EPO H-II, 2.2.5). 

Incorporation of essential matter or essential features at a later date is, 
however, subject to the restrictions set out in GL/PCT-EPO H-II, 2.2.1. It 
may be that the examiner has requested the applicant to furnish the 
document referred to, in order to be able to carry out a meaningful search 
(see ISPE Guidelines 15.37).

9.
"Reach-through" claims

Section F-III, 9 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

10. Sufficiency of disclosure and Rule 20.5(e) or Rule 20.5bis(e)
The application may contain sheets stamped "Not to be considered 
(R. 20.5(e), R. 20.5bis(e) or 20.7)". This means that these sheets were not 
allowed by the receiving Office (for formal or substantive reasons) or that 
the applicant has withdrawn those parts or elements in order to avoid re-
dating of the application. Such sheets thus do not form part of the 
application documents and should be ignored for search and examination.

In this case, the examiner must carefully evaluate whether the invention is 
still sufficiently disclosed without relying on the technical information 
contained in the withdrawn parts or elements. Should the examiner reach 
the conclusion that the requirements of Art. 5 are not satisfied, a 
corresponding objection is raised. See also GL/PCT-EPO F-III, 3 to 5.

11. Sufficiency of disclosure and clarity
An ambiguity in the claims may lead to an insufficiency objection. However, 
ambiguity also relates to the scope of the claims, i.e. Art. 6
(see 

GL/PCT-EPO F-IV, 4). Normally, therefore, an ambiguity in a claim will lead 
to an objection under Art. 5 only if the whole scope of the claim is affected, 
in the sense that it is impossible to carry out at all the invention defined 
therein. Otherwise an objection under Art. 6 is appropriate.

In particular, where a claim contains an ill-defined ("unclear", "ambiguous") 
parameter 
(see 
also 
GL/PCT-EPO F-IV, 4.11) 
and 
where, 
as 
a 

consequence, the skilled person would not know whether they were 
working within or outside of the scope of the claim, this, by itself, is not a 
reason to deny sufficiency of disclosure as required by Art. 5. Nor is such a 
lack of clear definition necessarily a matter for objection under Art. 6 only. 
What is decisive for establishing insufficiency within the meaning of Art. 5 is 
whether the parameter, in the specific case, is so ill-defined that the skilled 
person is not able, on the basis of the disclosure as a whole and using 
common general knowledge, to identify (without undue burden) the 
technical measures necessary to solve the problem underlying the 
application at issue.

GL/ISPE 4.12, 5.58


Part F – Chapter III-4

There is a delicate balance between Art. 5 and Art. 6 which has to be 
assessed on the merits of each individual case.

Chapter IV – Claims (Art. 6 and formal 
requirements)

1.
General

The international application must contain "one or more claims."

The claims must:

(i)
"define the matter for which protection is sought;"

(ii)
"be clear and concise;" and

(iii)
"be fully supported by the description."

This chapter sets out the appropriate form and content of the claims, 
together with how they should be interpreted for the purposes of assessing 
the novelty and inventive step of the inventions which they define and 
searching for prior art which may be relevant to making that assessment.

For form-filling of the written opinion in case of formal defects or of clarity, 
conciseness or support issues, see GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 3.2.4. 

2.
Form and content of claims

2.1
Technical features

Section F-IV, 2.1 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

It is not necessary that every feature should be expressed in terms of a 
structural 
limitation. 
Functional 
features 
are 
dealt 
with

Kinds of claim

3.1
Categories

See ISPE Guidelines 5.12.

For activities practised upon living things, see GL/PCT-EPO G-II, 4.2 and 
GL/PCT-EPO G-II, 5.4, which relate to subject-matter that may be excluded 
from search or preliminary examination.

3.2
Number of independent claims

The PCT has no provision equivalent to Rule 43(2) EPC. However, plural 
independent claims in one category which comply with the requirement of 
unity of invention (see GL/PCT-EPO F-V, 1) may be objected to under 
Art. 6 if they result in a lack of clarity and conciseness (see also 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 4). 

When assessing whether to raise an objection of lack of clarity or 
conciseness for such claims, the examiner will take examples (i) to (iv) in 
GL/EPO F-IV, 3.2 into account. 

3.3
Independent and dependent claims

Section F-IV, 3.4 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

3.4
Arrangement of claims

Section F-IV, 3.5 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

The EPO allows multiple dependent claims, provided that they do not 
detract from the clarity of the claims as a whole and that their arrangement 
does not create obscurity in the definition of the subject-matter to be 
protected. The EPO applies option GL/ISPE A5.16[2] of the Appendix to 
Chapter 5 of the ISPE Guidelines.

In case of unclarity, it may be appropriate for the examiner to first invite the 
applicant to provide informal clarification before the search is carried out 
(see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.3-3.6).

See GL/PCT-EPO F-IV, 3.7 for claims referring to a claim in a different 
category.

3.5
Subject-matter of a dependent claim

Section F-IV, 3.6 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

Clarity and interpretation of claims

4.1
Clarity

See ISPE Guidelines 5.31.

Where it is found that the claims lack clarity, it may be appropriate for the 
examiner to first invite the applicant to provide informal clarification before 
the search is carried out (see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.3-3.6).

4.12 Product-by-process claim
Claims for products defined in terms of a process of manufacture are 
allowable only if the products as such fulfil the requirements for 
patentability, i.e. inter alia that they are new and inventive. A product is not 
rendered novel merely by the fact that it is produced by means of a new 
process. A claim defining a product in terms of a process is to be construed 
as a claim to the product as such. The claim may for instance take the form 
"Product X obtainable by process Y". Irrespective of whether the term 
"obtainable", "obtained", "directly obtained" or an equivalent wording is 
used in the product-by-process claim, it is still directed to the product per se 
and confers absolute protection upon the product.

As regards novelty, when a product is defined by its method of 
manufacture, the question to be answered is whether the product under 
consideration is identical to known products. The burden of proof for an 
allegedly distinguishing "product-by-process" feature lies with the applicant, 
who has to provide evidence that the modification of the process 
parameters results in another product, for example by showing that distinct 
differences exist in the properties of the products. Nevertheless, the 
examiner needs to furnish reasoned argumentation to support the alleged 
lack of novelty of a product-by-process claim, especially if this objection is 
contested by the applicant.

The EPO applies option GL/ISPE A5.26[1] of the Appendix to Chapter 5 of 
the ISPE Guidelines.

4.12.1 Product claim with process features
Section F-IV, 4.12.1 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

4.13 Interpretation of expressions stating a purpose
Section F-IV, 4.13 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

For claims directed to a known substance or composition for use in a 
surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic method, see GL/PCT-EPO G-II, 4.2. 

4.14 Definition by reference to use or another entity
Section F-IV, 4.14 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

4.15 The expression "in"
Section F-IV, 4.15 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

Part F – Chapter IV-6
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

4.16 Use claims
The EPO applies the first sentence concerning "use" claims of point 
GL/ISPE A5.21 of the Appendix to Chapter 5 of the ISPE Guidelines.

Thus a claim in the form "the use of substance X as an insecticide" should 
not be interpreted as directed to the substance X recognisable (e.g. by 
further additives) as intended for use as an insecticide. Similarly, a claim for 
"the use of a transistor in an amplifying circuit" would be equivalent to a 
process claim for the process of amplifying using a circuit containing the 
transistor and should not be interpreted as being directed to "an amplifying 
circuit in which the transistor is used", nor to "the process of using the 
transistor in building such a circuit". However, a claim directed to the use of 
a process for a particular purpose is equivalent to a claim directed to that 
very same process.

Care should be taken when a claim relates to a two-step process which 
combines a use step with a product production step. This may be the case 
e.g. when a polypeptide and its use in a screening method have been 
defined as the only contribution to the art. An example of such a claim
would then be: 

"A method comprising: 

(a)
contacting polypeptide X with a compound to be screened and

(b)
determining whether the compound affects the activity of said 
polypeptide; 

and then formulating any active compound into a pharmaceutical 
composition." 

Many variations of such a claim are conceivable, but in essence they 
combine (a) a screening step (i.e. using a specified test material to select a 
compound having a given property) with (b) further production steps 
(i.e. further transforming the selected compound for instance into the 
desired composition). 

Two different types of process claim exist: (i) the use of an entity to achieve 
a technical effect and (ii) a process for the production of a product. The 
above claim and its analogues represent a combination of two different and 
irreconcilable types of process claim. Step (a) of the claim relates to a 
process of type (i), step (b) to a process of type (ii). Step (b) builds on the 
"effect" achieved by step (a), rather than step (a) feeding into step (b) a 
specific starting material and resulting in a specific product. This results in 
an unclear claim according to Art. 6. 

4.17 References to the description or drawings
See ISPE Guidelines 5.10. 

GL/ISPE A5.21

Rule 6.2(a)


March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part F – Chapter IV-7

4.18 Reference signs
See ISPE Guidelines 5.11. If there is a large number of different 
embodiments, only the reference signs of the most important embodiments 
need be incorporated in the independent claim(s). 

If text is added to reference signs in parentheses in the claims, lack of 
clarity can arise (Art. 6). Expressions such as "securing means (screw 13, 
nail 14)" or "valve assembly (valve seat 23, valve element 27, valve 
seat 28)" are not reference signs in the sense of Rule 6.2(b) but are special 
features. It is unclear whether the features added to the reference signs are 
limiting or not. Accordingly, such bracketed features are generally not 
permissible.
However, additional references to those figures, where 

particular reference signs are to be found, such as "(13 - Figure 3; 
14 - Figure 4)", are unobjectionable.

A lack of clarity can also arise with bracketed expressions that do not 
include reference signs, e.g. "(concrete) moulded brick". In contrast, 
bracketed expressions with a generally accepted meaning are allowable, 
e.g. "(meth)acrylate" which is known as an abbreviation for "acrylate and 
methacrylate". The use of brackets in chemical or mathematical formulae is 
also unobjectionable. The use of brackets for providing physical values 
complying with the requirements of Rule 10.1 is unobjectionable as well.

4.19 Negative limitations (e.g. disclaimers)
A claim's subject-matter is normally defined in terms of positive features 
indicating that certain technical elements are present. Exceptionally, 
however, the subject-matter may be restricted using a negative limitation 
expressly stating that particular features are absent. This may be done 
e.g. if the absence of a feature can be deduced from the application as 
filed.

Negative limitations such as disclaimers may be used only if adding 
positive features to the claim either would not define more clearly and 
concisely the subject-matter still protectable or would unduly limit the scope 
of the claim. It has to be clear what is excluded by means of the disclaimer. 
A claim containing one or more disclaimers must also fully comply with the 
clarity and conciseness requirements of Art. 6. 

For the allowability of disclaimers excluding embodiments that were 
disclosed in the original application as being part of the invention, see 
GL/PCT-EPO H-III, 4.2. With respect to the allowability of a disclaimer not 
disclosed in the application as filed see GL/PCT-EPO H-III, 4.1.

The EPO applies option GL/ISPE A20.21[2] of the Appendix to Chapter 20 
of the ISPE Guidelines.

4.20 "Comprising" vs. "consisting"

4.21 Functional definition of a pathological condition
Section F-IV, 4.21 in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

See also GL/PCT-EPO G-II, 4.2.

4.22 Broad claims
The PCT Regulations do not explicitly mention overly broad claims. 
However, objections to such claims may arise for various reasons.

Where there are discrepancies between the claims and the description, the 
claims are not sufficiently supported by the description (Art. 6) and also, in 
most 
cases, 
the 
invention 
is 
not 
sufficiently 
disclosed 
(Art. 5, 

see GL/PCT-EPO F-IV, 6.1).

Sometimes an objection of lack of novelty arises, for example if the claim is 
formulated in such broad terms that it also covers known subject-matter 
from other technical fields. Broad claims may also cover embodiments for 
which a purported effect has not been achieved. On raising an objection of 
lack of inventive step in such cases, see GL/PCT-EPO G-VII, 5.2.

4.23 Order of claims
There is no legal requirement that the first claim should be the broadest. 
However, Art. 6 requires that the claims must be clear not only individually 
but also as a whole. Therefore, where there are a large number of claims, 
they should be arranged with the broadest claim first. If the broadest of a 
large number of claims is a long way down, so that it could easily be 
overlooked, the applicant should be required either to re-arrange the claims 
in a more logical way or to direct attention to the broadest claim in the 
introductory part or in the summary of the description.

Furthermore, if the broadest claim is not the first one, the later broader 
claim must also be an independent claim. Consequently, where these 
independent claims are of the same category, an objection may also arise 
under Rule 6 if they result in a lack of clarity and conciseness (see 
GL/PCT-EPO F-IV, 3.2).

5.
Conciseness, number of claims

See ISPE Guidelines 5.42.

The EPO applies option GL/ISPE A5.42[2] of the Appendix to Chapter 5 of 
the ISPE Guidelines.

Where it is found that the claims lack conciseness under Art. 6, it may be 
appropriate for the examiner to first invite the applicant to provide informal 
clarification before the search is carried out (see GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.3 to 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.6).

6.2
Extent of generalisation

See ISPE Guidelines 5.52.

An invention which opens up a whole new field is entitled to more generality 
in the claims than one which is concerned with advances in a known 
technology. 

6.3
Objection of lack of support

See ISPE Guidelines 5.44.

Once the examiner has set out a reasoned case that, for example, a broad 
claim is not supported over the whole of its breadth, the onus of 
demonstrating that the claim is fully supported lies with the applicant 
(see GL/PCT-EPO F-III, 4).

The question of support is illustrated by examples (i) to (iii) in GL/EPO 
F-IV, 6.3. See also ISPE Guidelines 5.53. 

Where it is found that the claims lack support in the description under 
Art. 6, it may be appropriate for the examiner to first invite the applicant to 
provide informal clarification before the search is carried out (see 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.3-3.6).

6.4
Lack of support vs. insufficient disclosure

It should be noted that, although an objection of lack of support is an 
objection under Art. 6, it can often, as in examples (i) to (iii)
of 

GL/EPO F-IV, 6.3, also be considered as an objection of insufficient 
disclosure of the invention under Art. 5 (see GL/PCT-EPO F-III, 1 to 
GL/PCT-EPO F-III, 3), the objection being that the disclosure is insufficient 
to enable the skilled person to carry out the "invention" over the whole of 
the broad field claimed (although sufficient in respect of a narrow 
"invention"). Both requirements are designed to reflect the principle that the 
terms of a claim should be commensurate with, or be justified by, the 
invention's technical contribution to the art. Therefore, the extent to which 
an invention is sufficiently disclosed is also highly relevant to the issue of 
support. The reasons for failure to meet the requirements of Art. 5 may in 
effect be the same as those that lead to the infringement of Art. 6 as well, 
namely that the invention, over the whole range claimed, extends to 
technical subject-matter not made available to the person skilled in the art 
by the application as filed.

For example, where a technical feature is described and highlighted in the 
description as being an essential feature of the invention, to comply with 
Art. 6 this must also be part of the independent claim(s) defining the 
invention (see GL/PCT-EPO, F-IV, 4.5.1). By the same token, if the 
(essential) technical feature in question is absent from the claims, and no 
information is given on how to perform the claimed invention successfully 
without the use of said feature, the description does not disclose the 
invention defined in the claim(s) in the manner prescribed by Art. 5.

Art. 5, 6


Part F – Chapter IV-10
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

An objection under both Art. 5 and Art. 6 may also be justified. An example 
would be a claim relating to a known class of chemical compounds defined 
by measurable parameters, when the description does not disclose a 
technical teaching allowing the skilled person to manufacture those 
compounds complying with the parametric definition, and this is not 
otherwise feasible by the application of common general knowledge or 
routine experimentation. Such a claim would be both technically not 
supported and not sufficiently disclosed, regardless of whether the 
parametric definition meets the clarity requirement of Art. 6.

Annex
Examples concerning essential features

The Annex to F-IV of the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO contains 
examples of how to evaluate whether a claim contains all essential features 
of the invention. The examiner will apply the same criteria when assessing 
essential features under the PCT mutatis mutandis.

Part F – Chapter V-1

Chapter V – Unity of invention

1.
Assessment of and reasoning for unity of invention

Given the harmonisation of the definitions concerning unity of invention in 
Rules 13.1 and 13.2 PCT compared with Art. 82 EPC and Rule 44(1) EPC
respectively, the formal criteria for unity in the EPC and the PCT systems 
are the same. Hence, search and substantive examination follow the same 
principles in both the European and PCT procedures as far as the 
reasoning for unity of invention is concerned. 

As a consequence, the parts relating to the assessment of unity of 
invention and its reasoning of GL/EPO F-V, 1 to F-V, 3 and all subsections 
apply mutatis mutandis to the PCT procedure, with the exception of those 
passages in GL/EPO F-V, 2.1 and F-V, 3.2.1 relating to Rule 43(2) EPC. 
This is because Rule 43(2) EPC has no equivalent in the PCT, which also 
means that, in the PCT procedure, multiple independent claims in the same 
category need to be considered under the Art. 6 conciseness requirement
(see GL/EPO F-IV, 3.2 and GL/PCT-EPO F-IV, 3.2).

Intermediate 
documents 
cited 
under 
Rule 33.1(c)
(see 

GL/PCT-EPO B-X, 9.2.4) are considered in the same way as documents 
under Art. 54(3) EPC (see GL/EPO F-V, 3.1) and cannot be used for a non-
unity objection.

This is also the case for novelty-destroying documents cited under 
Rule 33.1(a) as accidental anticipation within the meaning of decisions 
G 1/03
and G 1/16
of the EPO’s Enlarged Board of Appeal (see 

GL/EPO F-V, 3.1.2).

2.
Lack of unity during search

In many and probably most instances, lack of unity will have been noted at 
the search stage. In such cases, a search is conducted for the invention 
first mentioned in the claims and the applicant is invited to pay additional 
search fees with Form PCT/ISA/206. See GL/PCT-EPO B-VII, 2.

See also ISPE Guidelines 10.60 for the process at the international search 
stage and ISPE Guidelines 10.83 for the process at the supplementary 
international search stage.

GL/EPO F-V, 4 applies mutatis mutandis, with the exception of those 
aspects already covered above.

Rule 40, 45bis.6


Part F – Chapter V-2

3.
Lack of unity during the PCT Chapter II procedure 

If an invitation to pay additional fees was issued during Chapter I and the 
applicant paid some or all of the required additional fees, and if, where 
applicable, the objection as to lack of unity was at least partly upheld during 
a protest procedure, then under Chapter II the applicant will normally be 
invited (using Form 405) to pay additional preliminary examination fees if all 
the searched inventions are also to be examined under Chapter II. 
Inventions for which no search fees were paid cannot be pursued and will 
thus also not be objected to or commented on. See GL/PCT-EPO C-V.

Chapter VI – Priority

1.
The right to priority

For the establishment of the WO-ISA in relation to the priority claim, see 
GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 4 and subsections.

1.1
Filing date as effective date

See ISPE Guidelines 6.01 and ISPE Guidelines 15.11 A, B and C.

1.2
Priority date as effective date

When an international application claims the right of priority of the date of 
filing of an earlier application, the priority date (i.e. the filing date of the 
earlier application) will be used to calculate certain time limits.

The priority claim must refer to an earlier application. The day of filing of the 
earlier application not being included in the priority period (Art. 8(2) PCT in 
conjunction 
with 
Article 4C(2) 
of 
the 
Paris 
Convention
and 

Rule 2.4(a) PCT), the priority period starts on the day following the date of 
filing of the earlier application. Thus, an "earlier" application is to be 
understood as an application that has been filed at least a day before the 
application claiming priority.

Furthermore, the priority date becomes the effective date for the purposes 
of international examination, i.e. the written opinion (of either the ISA or the 
IPEA) and the international preliminary examination report. The relevant 
date for the purposes of the international search is always the international 
filing date.

See ISPE Guidelines 6.02.

1.3
Validly claiming priority

See ISPE Guidelines 6.03
and ISPE Guidelines 15.11
as well as 

GL/PCT-EPO A-VI, 1.6.

1.4
Subsequent application considered as first application

See ISPE Guidelines 6.04.

Examples of applications that cannot be recognised as a "first application" 
are:

(i)
US applications which are a "continuation" of a previous application 
("con");

(ii)
US applications which are a "continuation in part" of a previous 
application ("cip"), in so far as the subject-matter in question was 
already disclosed in the original US application;

(iii)
national applications claiming priority from a previous national 
application or national utility model.

In the case of US con or cip applications, the first sentence of the 
description reads as follows: "This application is a continuation in part 
(continuation) of Serial Number .... filed .....". The following information is 
found on the title page under the heading "CONTINUING DATA******": 
"VERIFIED THIS APPLICATION IS A CIP (or CON) OF ........" A form 
headed "Declaration for Patent Application" must also be attached to the 
end of the application (in this case the priority document), listing earlier 
foreign or US applications under the heading "foreign priority benefits under 
Title 35, United States Code, 119" or "benefit under Title 35, U.S.C., 120 of 
any United States application(s)".

which 
is 
allowable 
under 
Art. 34(2)(b)
(see 

GL/PCT-EPO H-III, 4.1 and GL/PCT-EPO H-III, 4.2) does not change the 
identity of the invention within the meaning of Art. 8. Therefore, such a 
disclaimer could be introduced when drafting and filing a successive 
international application, without affecting the right to priority from the first 
application not containing the disclaimer.

3.5
Withdrawal of priority claims

The applicant may withdraw a priority claim, made in the international 
application under Article 8(1), at any time prior to the expiration of 
30 months from the priority date. 

3.6
Correction or addition of priority claim

See 
ISPE Guidelines 6.11, 
ISPE Guidelines 6.16
and 

ISPE Guidelines 8.10.

3.7
Re-establishment of rights in respect of the priority period

The applicant may file a request for restoration of the priority right up to two 
months after expiry of the priority year from the claimed priority.

In the international phase, restoration can be granted under both the "due 
care" and "unintentional" criteria. The EPO as receiving Office and as 
designated Office in the regional phase will decide on the basis of the "due 
care" criterion (which is the same criterion as used for EP applications with 
respect to re-establishment of rights under Art. 122 EPC). If the EPO was 
not the receiving Office, the request may have been decided upon under 
the "unintentional" criterion.

If the priority right was restored by the receiving Office under the "due care" 
criterion, no new request need be filed with the EPO as designated/elected 
Office, since the EPO will, in principle, recognise the decision of the 
receiving Office. If, however, the EPO has reasonable doubt that the 
requirements for grant were not met, it will notify the applicant accordingly. 
In this communication the reasons for such doubt will be indicated and a 
time limit will be set within which the applicant may submit comments. 

If the priority right was restored by the receiving Office under the 
"unintentional" criterion, a new request needs to be filed with the EPO as 
designated/elected Office, since the EPO is not bound by the decision of 
any receiving Office under the "unintentional" criterion.

A priority claim may not be considered invalid on the basis that the 
international application has an international filing date which is later than 
the date on which the priority period expired, provided that the international 
filing date is within two months of that date. The examiner may make a 
remark in the WO-ISA indicating the number of days by which the 12-month 
priority period has been exceeded.

For filling out the WO-ISA where the filing date exceeds the earliest priority 
date 
by 
over 
twelve months 
and 
a 
further 
two months,

PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part G – Chapter I-1

Chapter I – Patentability

1.
General disclaimer

Under Art. 150(2) EPC, an international application filed under the PCT 
may be the subject of proceedings before the EPO. In such proceedings, 
the provisions of the PCT and its Regulations are applied, supplemented by 
the provisions of the EPC. In case of conflict, the provisions of the PCT and 
its Regulations prevail. 

The EPO, acting as ISA or IPEA, has established practice on how the 
examiner assesses novelty and inventive step. For most subject-matter this 
practice is identical to that used in proceedings for European patent 
applications. However, for some subject-matter the ISPE Guidelines 
deviate from the practice in European proceedings, and for other 
subject-matter they recognise that different offices adopt different 
approaches. As a result of Art. 150(2) EPC, the EPO as ISA/IPEA will, for 
the assessment of novelty and inventive step, generally apply the 
provisions of the PCT and, where these are not sufficient, will base its 
assessment on its established practice. In the latter case, these Guidelines 
then state that "the principles as laid down in the corresponding section in 
the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO apply mutatis mutandis." 

It should be borne in mind that when an international application validly 
enters the regional phase before the EPO, it is considered as a European 
patent application. Consequently, the EPO will apply its criteria for 
examination as laid down in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO for 
any subject-matter.

2.
General remarks

The aim of the PCT is to allow the applicant to obtain a preliminary and 
non-binding opinion on the patentability of the claimed subject-matter 
before entering the regional phase. The PCT procedure cannot serve the 
purpose of granting a patent as is the case for example under the EPC.

Rule 43bis.1(a)



March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part G – Chapter II-1

Chapter II – Inventions

1.
General remarks

The objective of the international preliminary examination is to formulate a 
preliminary and non-binding opinion on the questions whether the claimed 
invention appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step and to be 
industrially applicable.

The PCT does not define what is meant by "invention", but Rules 39 and 67
contain a list of subject-matter for which the ISA or IPEA is not required to 
carry out an international search or an international preliminary 
examination, 
respectively 
(see 
also 
GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 2).
The 

Agreement between the EPO and WIPO in relation to the functioning of the 
EPO as an International Authority under the PCT indicates the subject-
matter which the EPO is not required to search or examine, and according 
to its Art. 4 and Annex C the discretion not to search or examine is 
exercised by the EPO as ISA and IPEA only to the extent that such 
subject-matter is not searched under the provisions of the EPC, specifically 
Art. 52(2), Art. 52(3), Art. 53(b) and Art. 53(c) EPC.

4.
Exceptions to patentability

4.1
Matter contrary to public order or morality

Unlike the EPC, the PCT does not explicitly rule out the patentability of 
subject-matter for reasons of public order or morality. However, according 
to Rule 9, the application must not contain any expressions contrary to 
public order or morality, and under the Agreement between the EPO and 
WIPO the EPO may exclude matter which would be excluded under 
Art. 53(a) EPC. Generally, no search or preliminary examination is carried 
out on such matter by the EPO as ISA/IPEA. Section G-II, 4.1, in the 
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies mutatis mutandis.

4.2
Surgery, therapy and diagnostic methods

See ISPE Guidelines 9.08-9.10. However, under the Agreement between 
the EPO and WIPO these fall within the EPO's discretion to exclude matter 
which would be excluded under Art. 53(c) EPC. Generally, no search or 
preliminary examination is carried out on such matter by the EPO as 
ISA/IPEA. Section G-II, 4.2, in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO
applies mutatis mutandis.

Exclusions and exceptions for biotechnological inventions

5.1
General remarks and definitions

"Biotechnological inventions" are inventions which concern a product 
consisting of or containing biological material or a process by means of 
which biological material is produced, processed or used. "Biological 
material" means any material containing genetic information and capable of 
reproducing itself or being reproduced in a biological system.

5.2
Biotechnological inventions

See ISPE Guidelines 9.06. However, under the Agreement between the 
EPO and WIPO these fall within the EPO's discretion to exclude matter 
which would be excluded under Art. 53(b) EPC. Generally, no search or 
preliminary examination is carried out on such matter by the EPO as 
ISA/IPEA. Section G-II, 5.2, in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO
applies mutatis mutandis.

5.3
Exceptions

The PCT, unlike the EPC, does not explicitly exclude carrying out an 
international search or an international preliminary examination on specific 
subject-matter related to biotechnological inventions. However, under the 
Agreement between the EPO and WIPO these fall within the EPO's 
discretion to exclude matter which would be excluded under Art. 53 EPC. 
Generally, no search or preliminary examination is carried out on such 
matter by the EPO as ISA/IPEA. Section G-II, 5.3, in the Guidelines for 
Examination in the EPO applies mutatis mutandis.

5.4
Plant and animal varieties, essentially biological processes for 

the production of plants or animals
See ISPE Guidelines 9.06. However, under the Agreement between the 
EPO and WIPO these fall within the EPO's discretion to exclude matter 
which would be excluded under Art. 53(b) EPC. Generally, no search or 
preliminary examination is carried out on such matter by the EPO as 
ISA/IPEA. Section G-II, 5.4
and subsections, in the Guidelines for 

Examination in the EPO applies mutatis mutandis.

5.5
Microbiological processes

See ISPE Guidelines 9.06. GL/EPO G-II, 5.5, applies mutatis mutandis.

Chapter IV – Prior art

1.
General remarks and definition

An invention is to be "considered novel if it is not anticipated by the prior 
art". The "prior art shall consist of everything which has been made 
available to the public anywhere in the world by means of written disclosure 
(including drawings and other illustrations) and which is capable of being of 
assistance in determining that the claimed invention is or is not new and 
that it does or does not involve an inventive step (i.e., that it is or is not 
obvious), provided that the making available to the public occurred prior to 
the international filing date". The scope of this definition should be noted. 
There are no restrictions whatsoever as to the geographical location where 
or the language in which the relevant information was made available to the 
public; also no age limit is stipulated for the documents or other sources of 
the information.

See also ISPE Guidelines 11.01 and ISPE Guidelines 11.12.

The principles to be applied in determining whether other kinds of prior art, 
e.g. relating to use (which could be introduced e.g. by a third party, see 
GL/PCT-EPO E-II, ISPE Guidelines 16.57 and PCT/AI section 801), have 
been made available to the public are governed by Rules 33.1(b) and 64.2.

For 
the 
examination 
of 
the 
novelty 
of 
claimed 
subject-matter, 

see GL/PCT-EPO G-VI.

A written description, i.e. a document, should be regarded as made 
available to the public if, at the relevant date, it was possible for members 
of the public to gain knowledge of the content of the document and there 
was no bar of confidentiality restricting the use or dissemination of such 
knowledge. For instance, German utility models ("Gebrauchsmuster") are 
already publicly available as of their date of entry in the Register of utility 
models ("Eintragungstag"), which precedes the date of announcement in 
the Patent Bulletin ("Bekanntmachung im Patentblatt").

2.
Enabling disclosures

The principles as laid down in section G-IV, 2, in the Guidelines for 
Examination in the EPO apply mutatis mutandis.

3.
Date of filing or priority date as effective date

It should be noted that for the purpose of international preliminary 
examination all prior art is taken into account which was publicly available 
before the international filing date or, where a priority has been validly 
claimed, before the date of priority. It should be remembered that different 
claims, or different alternatives claimed in one claim, may have different 
effective dates, i.e. the date of filing or (one of) the claimed priority date(s). 
The question of novelty must be considered against each claim (or part of a 
claim where a claim specifies a number of alternatives), and prior art in 
relation to one claim or one part of a claim may include matter, e.g. an 
intermediate document (see GL/PCT-EPO B-X, 9.2.4), which cannot be 
cited against another claim or another alternative in the same claim 
because it has an earlier effective date.

Part G – Chapter IV-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines

If the applicant subsequently furnishes missing parts of the description, 
parts of the claims or all or parts of the drawings under Rule 20.5, the 
international filing date is the date on which the purported international 
application is completed by the furnishing of the missing parts, unless the 
missing parts are completely contained in the priority document and the 
requirements given in Rule 20.6 are satisfied, in which case the original 
filing date is maintained. The date of the application as a whole is thus 
either the date on which the missing parts are received or the original filing 
date (see GL/PCT-EPO C-III, 2, and GL/PCT-EPO H-II, 2.2.2).

If the applicant subsequently furnishes (a) correct element(s) (an element 
being the description or the claims) or correct parts of the description, parts 
of the claims or all or parts of the drawings under Rule 20.5bis, the 
international filing date is the date on which the purported international 
application is corrected by the furnishing of the correct elements or parts, 
unless the correct elements or parts are completely contained in the priority 
document and the requirements given in Rule 20.6 are satisfied, in which 
case the original filing date is maintained. The date of the application as a 
whole is thus either the date on which the correct elements or parts are 
received or the original filing date (see GL/PCT-EPO C-III, 2, and 
GL/PCT-EPO H-II, 2.2.2).

4.
Documents in a non-official language of the (S)ISA or IPEA

Where applicants

(i)
dispute the relevance of a document in a non-official language cited 
in the search report (for procedure at the search stage, 
see GL/PCT-EPO B-X, 9.1.2 and 9.1.3), and 

(ii)
give specific reasons, 

examiners should consider whether, in the light of these reasons and of the 
other prior art available to them, they are justified in pursuing the matter. If 
so, they should obtain a translation of the document (or merely the relevant 
part of it if that can be easily identified). If they remain of the view that the 
document is relevant, they should send a copy of the translation to the 
applicant with the next communication in the PCT Chapter II phase.

4.1
Machine translations

In order to overcome the language barrier constituted by a document in an 
unfamiliar non-official language, it might be appropriate for the examiner to 
rely on a machine translation of the document, which should be sent to the 
applicant. If only part of the translated document is relevant, the particular 
passage relied upon should be identified. A translation has to serve the 
purpose of rendering the meaning of the text in a familiar language. 
Therefore mere grammatical or syntactical errors which have no impact on 
the possibility of understanding the content do not hinder its qualification as 
a translation. 

A general statement that machine translations as such cannot be trusted is 
not sufficient to contest the value of the translation. If the applicant objects 
to the use of a specific machine translation, the applicant bears the burden 

Rule 20.5

Rule 20.5bis


March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part G – Chapter IV-3

of adducing evidence (in the form of, for instance, an improved translation 
of the whole or salient parts of the document) showing the extent to which 
the quality of the machine translation is defective and should therefore not 
be relied upon.

When the applicant provides substantiated reasoning for questioning the 
objections raised based on the translated text, the examiner will have to 
take these reasons into account, similarly to when the publication date is 
questioned.

5.
Conflict with other applications

5.1
Prior art pursuant to Rules 33.1(c) and 64.3

Under the PCT, the prior art does not comprise the content of other 
applications filed or validly claiming a priority date earlier than – but 
published on or after – the date of filing or valid date of priority of the 
application being examined. However, attention must be drawn to such 
applications in the international search report and, where applicable, the 
preliminary examination report, as they may become relevant under 
Article 54(3) EPC (see also GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 4.3). By the "content" of an 
application is meant the whole disclosure, i.e. the description, drawings and 
claims, including:

(i)
any matter explicitly disclaimed (with the exception of disclaimers for 
unworkable embodiments);

(ii)
any matter for which an allowable reference (see GL/EPO F-III, 8, 
penultimate paragraph) to other documents is made; and

(iii)
prior art insofar as explicitly described.

However, the "content" does not include any priority document (the purpose 
of such document being merely to determine to what extent the priority date 
is valid for the disclosure of the international application).

5.2
Co-pending applications

The PCT does not deal explicitly with the case of co-pending international 
applications of the same applicant of the same effective date, see 
ISPE Guidelines 11.10.

6.
Prior art made available to the public anywhere in the world by 

non-written disclosure
A non-written disclosure is not considered part of the prior art for the 
purposes of Art. 33(2) and (3) if the date of that non-written disclosure is 
indicated in a written disclosure which has been made available to the 
public on or after the relevant date of the application (i.e. on or after the 
international filing date or, if a priority has been validly claimed, the earliest 
priority date).

Part G – Chapter IV-4
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

6.1
Types of non-written disclosure, in particular use, and instances 

of prior art made available in any other way
Making available to the public may occur by means of an oral disclosure, 
use, exhibition or other non-written means. Use may be constituted by 
producing, offering, marketing or otherwise exploiting a product, or by 
offering or marketing a process or its application or by applying the 
process. Marketing may be effected, for example, by sale or exchange.

Prior art may also be made available to the public in other ways, as for 
example by demonstrating an object or process in specialist training 
courses or on television.

Availability to the public in any other way also includes all possibilities 
which technological progress may subsequently offer of making available 
the aspect of the prior art concerned.

It should be borne in mind that for the purposes of the international search 
and the international preliminary examination a non-written disclosure is to 
be considered part of the prior art for the purposes of Art. 33(2) and (3) only 
if its content is confirmed by a written disclosure that was made available to 
the public earlier than the relevant date as defined by Rule 64.1(b).

6.2
Matters to be determined as regards use

When the ISA or the IPEA has gained knowledge of an object or process 
that has been used in such a way that it is comprised in the prior art 
(e.g. by a third party, see GL/PCT-EPO E-II, ISPE Guidelines 16.57 and 
PCT/AI section 801), the following details have to be determined:

(i)
whether there is a written disclosure that was made available to the 
public earlier than the relevant date as defined by Rule 64.1(b) which 
confirms the use of the object or the process;

(ii)
the date on which an alleged use occurred, i.e. whether there was 
any instance of use before the relevant date (prior use);

(iii)
what has been used, in order to determine the degree of similarity 
between the object used and the subject-matter of the application; 
and

(iv)
all the circumstances relating to the use, in order to determine 
whether and to what extent it was made available to the public, as for 
example the place of use and the form of use. These factors are 
important in that, for example, the details of a demonstration of a 
manufacturing process in a factory or of the delivery and sale of a 
product may well provide information as regards the possibility of the 
subject-matter having become available to the public.

6.2.1
General principles

Subject-matter should be regarded as made available to the public by use 
or in any other way if, at the relevant date, it was possible for members of 
the public to gain knowledge of the subject-matter and there was no bar of 
confidentiality restricting the use or dissemination of such knowledge. This 

Rule 33.1(b),
Rule 64.2

Rule 33.1(b),
Rule 64.2


March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part G – Chapter IV-5

may, for example, arise if an object is unconditionally sold to a member of 
the public, since the buyer thereby acquires unlimited possession of any 
knowledge which may be obtained from the object. Even where in such 
cases the specific features of the object may not be ascertained from an 
external examination, but only by further analysis, those features are 
nevertheless to be considered as having been made available to the public. 
This is irrespective of whether or not particular reasons can be identified for 
analysing the composition or internal structure of the object. These specific 
features only relate to the intrinsic features. Extrinsic characteristics, which 
are only revealed when the product is exposed to interaction with 
specifically chosen outside conditions, e.g. reactants or the like, in order to 
provide a particular effect or result or to discover potential results or 
capabilities, therefore point beyond the product per se as they are 
dependent on deliberate choices being made. Typical examples are the 
first or further application as a pharmaceutical product of a known 
substance or composition and the use of a known compound for a 
particular purpose, based on a new technical effect.
Thus, such 

characteristics cannot be considered as already having been made 
available to the public.

If, on the other hand, an object could be seen in a given place (a factory, for 
example) to which members of the public not bound to secrecy, including 
persons with sufficient technical knowledge to ascertain the specific 
features of the object, had access, all knowledge which an expert was able 
to gain from a purely external examination is to be regarded as having been 
made available to the public. In such cases, however, all concealed 
features which could be ascertained only by dismantling or destroying the 
object will not be deemed to have been made available to the public.

6.2.2
Agreement on secrecy

The basic principle to be adopted is that subject-matter has not been made 
available to the public by use or in any other way if there is an express or 
tacit agreement on secrecy which has not been broken, or if the 
circumstances of the case are such that such secrecy derives from a 
relationship of good faith or trust. Good faith and trust are factors which 
may occur in contractual or commercial relationships.

6.2.3
Use on non-public property

As a general rule, use on non-public property, for example in factories and 
barracks, is not considered as use made available to the public, because 
company employees and soldiers are usually bound to secrecy, save in 
cases where the objects or processes used are exhibited, explained or 
shown to the public in such places, or where specialists not bound to 
secrecy are able to recognise their essential features from the outside. 
Clearly the above-mentioned "non-public property" does not refer to the 
premises of a third party to whom the object in question was unconditionally 
sold or the place where the public could see the object in question or 
ascertain features of it.

6.2.4
Example of the accessibility of objects used

A press for producing light building (hard fibre) boards was installed in a 
factory shed. Although the door bore the notice "Unauthorised persons not 

GL/EPO G-IV, 7.2.2


Part G – Chapter IV-6
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

admitted", customers (in particular dealers in building materials and clients 
who were interested in purchasing light building boards) were given the 
opportunity of seeing the press although no form of demonstration or 
explanation was given. An obligation to secrecy was not imposed as, 
according to witnesses, the company did not consider such visitors as a 
possible source of competition. These visitors were not genuine specialists, 
i.e. they did not manufacture such boards or presses, but were not entirely 
laymen either. In view of the simple construction of the press, the essential 
features of the invention concerned were bound to be evident to anyone 
observing it. There was therefore a possibility that these customers, and in 
particular the dealers in building materials, would recognise these essential 
features of the press and, as they were not bound to secrecy, they would 
be free to communicate this information to others.

6.2.5
Example of the inaccessibility of a process

The subject of the patent concerns a process for the manufacture of a 
product. As proof that this process had been made available to the public 
by use, a similar already known product was asserted to have been 
produced by the process claimed. However, it could not be clearly 
ascertained, even after an exhaustive examination, by which process it had 
been produced.

6.3
Prior art made available by means of oral description

If the prior art was made available to the public by an oral description 
before the relevant date (i.e. the date of filing of the application or, if 
applicable, the date of the earliest validly claimed priority) but a document 
which reproduces the oral description was only published on or after that 
relevant date, the ISR and the IPER draw attention to this non-written 
disclosure in the manner provided for in Rule 70.9 (Rules 33.1(b) and 64.2).

6.4
Internet disclosures

As a matter of principle, disclosures on the internet form part of the prior 
art. Information disclosed on the internet or in online databases is 
considered to be publicly available as of the date the information was 
publicly posted. Internet websites often contain highly relevant technical 
information. Certain information may even be available only on the internet 
from such websites. This includes, for example, online manuals and 
tutorials for software products (such as video games) or other products with 
a short life cycle.

As regards establishing the publication date and the standard and burden 
of proof, in particular with technical journals or "print equivalent" 
publications, the principles as laid down in the Guidelines for Examination 
in the EPO (GL/EPO G-IV, 7.5.1-7.5.6) apply mutatis mutandis.

6.5
Standards and standard preparatory documents

The principles as laid down in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO 
(GL/EPO G-IV, 7.6) apply mutatis mutandis.

7.
Cross-references between prior-art documents

If a document (the "primary" document) refers explicitly to another 
document (the "secondary" document) as providing more detailed

information on certain features, the teaching of the latter is to be regarded 
as incorporated into the primary document if the document was available to 
the public on the publication date of the primary document. The relevant 
date for novelty purposes, however, is always the date of the primary 
document.

8.

Chapter V – Non-prejudicial disclosures

1.
General

The PCT acknowledges that in certain cases the invention may have been
disclosed before the relevant date for the purposes of the PCT in such a 
way that it is not considered to form part of the prior art in accordance with 
the national law of one or more designated Offices (Rule 51bis.1(a)(v)). 

Therefore, it should be borne in mind that, upon validly entering the 
regional phase before the EPO, the standards for non-prejudicial 
disclosures as laid down in Article 55(1) EPC will be applied.

Consequently, the principles as laid down in Chapter G-V of the Guidelines 
for Examination in the EPO apply mutatis mutandis.

Chapter VI – Novelty

1.
Prior art pursuant to Art. 33(2)

Under the PCT, an invention is considered to be novel if it is not anticipated 
by the prior art. Everything which is made available to the public anywhere 
in the world by means of a written disclosure is considered prior art 
provided that such making available occurred prior to the relevant date. In 
cases where the making available to the public occurred by non-written
means, it constitutes prior art only if a written disclosure that occurred 
before the relevant date confirms the non-written disclosure. The relevant 
date is the international filing date or, where at least one priority has been 
validly claimed, the date of the earliest priority. It should be noted that in 
considering novelty (as distinct from inventive step), it is not permissible to 
combine separate items of prior art together. It is also not permissible to 
combine separate items belonging to different embodiments described in 
one and the same document, unless such combination has specifically 
been suggested, see also ISPE Guidelines 12.06.

For the specific case of selection inventions see ISPE Guidelines 12.10.

Furthermore, any matter explicitly disclaimed (with the exception of 
disclaimers which exclude unworkable embodiments) and prior art 
acknowledged in a document, insofar as explicitly described therein, are to 
be regarded as incorporated in the document.

It is further permissible to use a dictionary or similar document of reference 
in order to interpret a special term used in a document.

2.
Implicit features or well-known equivalents

A document takes away the novelty of any claimed subject-matter derivable 
directly and unambiguously from that document including any features 
implicit to a person skilled in the art in what is expressly mentioned in the 
document, e.g. a disclosure of the use of rubber in circumstances where 
clearly its elastic properties are used even if this is not explicitly stated 
takes away the novelty of the use of an elastic material. The limitation to 
subject-matter "derivable directly and unambiguously" from the document is 
important. Thus, when considering novelty, it is not correct to interpret the 
teaching of a document as embracing well-known equivalents which are not 
disclosed in the documents; this is a matter of inventive step.

3.
Relevant date of a prior document

In determining novelty, a prior document should be read as it would have 
been read by a person skilled in the art on the relevant date of the 
document. For the purpose of assessing novelty the "relevant" date for 
written disclosures is the date as defined by Rule 64.1(b), i.e. either the 
international filing date of the application under consideration or, if a priority 
has been validly claimed, the application date of that earlier application (if 
the filing date of the application is within the two-month period after the 
expiry of the priority period of the earlier application, the relevant date is 
also the application date of that earlier application); for non-written 
disclosures see Rules 33.1(b) and 64.2.

4.
Enabling disclosure of a prior document

Subject-matter described in a document can only be regarded as having 
been made available to the public, and therefore as comprised in the prior 
art pursuant to Rules 33 and 64, if the information given therein to the 
skilled person is sufficient to enable them, at the relevant date of the 
document, to practise the technical teaching which is the subject of the 
document, taking into account also the general knowledge at that time in 
the field to be expected of them.

Similarly, it should be noted that a chemical compound, the name or 
formula of which is mentioned in a prior-art document, is not thereby 
considered as known, unless the information in the document, together, 
where appropriate, with knowledge generally available on the relevant date 
of the document, enables it to be prepared and separated or, for instance in 
the case of a product of nature, only to be separated.

The EPO applies option A12.02[1] of the Appendix to Chapter 12 of the 
ISPE Guidelines.

5.
Generic disclosure and specific examples

In considering novelty, it should be borne in mind that a generic disclosure 
does not usually take away the novelty of any specific example falling 
within the terms of that disclosure, but that a specific disclosure does take 
away the novelty of a generic claim embracing that disclosure, e.g. a 
disclosure of copper takes away the novelty of metal as a generic concept, 
but not the novelty of any metal other than copper, and one of rivets takes 
away the novelty of fastening means as a generic concept, but not the 
novelty of any fastening other than rivets.

6.
Implicit disclosure and parameters

In the case of a prior document, the lack of novelty may be apparent from 
what is explicitly stated in the document itself. Alternatively, it may be 
implicit in the sense that, in carrying out the teaching of the prior document, 
the skilled person would inevitably arrive at a result falling within the terms 
of the claim. An objection of lack of novelty of this kind should be raised by 
the examiner only where there can be no reasonable doubt as to the 
practical effect of the prior teaching. Situations of this kind may also occur 
when the claims define the invention, or a feature thereof, by parameters. It 
may happen that in the relevant prior art a different parameter, or no 
parameter at all, is mentioned. If the known and the claimed products are 
identical in all other respects (which is to be expected if, for example, the 
starting products and the manufacturing processes are identical), then in 
the first place an objection of lack of novelty arises. The burden of proof for 
an alleged distinguishing feature lies with the applicant. No benefit of doubt 
can be accorded if the applicant does not provide evidence in support of 
the allegations. If, on the other hand, the applicant is able to show, e.g. by 
appropriate comparison tests, that differences do exist with respect to the 
parameters, it is questionable whether the application discloses all the 
features essential to manufacture products having the parameters specified 
in the claims (Art. 5).

7.
Examination of novelty

In determining novelty of the subject-matter of claims, the examiner should 
remember that, particularly for claims directed to a physical entity, 
non-distinctive characteristics of a particular intended use should be 
disregarded. For example, a claim to a substance X for use as a catalyst 
would not be considered to be novel over the same substance known as a 
dye, unless the use referred to implies a particular form of the substance 
(e.g. the presence of certain additives) which distinguishes it from the 
known form of the substance. That is to say, characteristics not explicitly 
stated, but implied by the particular use, should be taken into account.

A known compound is not rendered novel merely because it is available 
with a different degree of purity if the purity can be achieved by 
conventional means.

7.1
Second or further medical use of known pharmaceutical 

products
How the novelty of second or further medical use claims is assessed 
depends on the IPEA. The examiner at the EPO as IPEA examines the 
novelty of the subject-matter in view of the entry into the regional phase 
before the EPO and therefore will apply the principles as laid down in 
GL/EPO G-VI, 6.1 and subsections. See GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 2.1, for the 
treatment of medical use claims by the EPO as ISA.

7.2
Second non-medical use

A claim to the use of a known compound for a particular purpose (second 
non-medical use) which is based on a technical effect will be interpreted by 
the EPO examiner as including that technical effect as a functional 
technical feature. The novelty of the use of the known compound for the 
known production of a known product cannot be deduced from a new 
property of the produced product. In such a case, the use of a compound 
for the production of a product will be interpreted as a process for 
production of the product with the compound. Therefore, it can be regarded 
as novel only if the process of production as such is novel. 

8.
Selection inventions

Selection inventions deal with the selection of individual elements, subsets, 
or subranges, which have not been explicitly mentioned, within a larger 
known set or range. The examiner of the EPO as IPEA will assess the 
novelty of the subject-matter according to the principles laid down in 
GL/EPO G-VI, 7 and subsection.

9.
Novelty of "reach-through" claims

"Reach-through" claims are defined as claims attempting to obtain 
protection for a chemical product (and also uses thereof, compositions 
thereof, etc.) by defining that product functionally in terms of its action 
(e.g. agonist, antagonist) on a biological target such as an enzyme or 
receptor. In many such cases, the applicant functionally defines chemical 
compounds in this way by reference to a newly identified biological target. 
However, compounds which bind to and exercise this action on that 
biological target are not necessarily novel compounds simply because the 
biological target which they act on is new. Indeed in many cases, applicants 

GL/ISPE 12.05

GL/ISPE 12.10


Part G – Chapter VI-4
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

themselves provide test results in the application whereby known 
compounds are shown to exert this action on the new biological target, thus 
demonstrating that compounds falling within the functional definition of the 
"reach-through" claim are known in the prior art and so establishing that a 
reach-through claim relating to compounds defined in this way lacks 
novelty.

PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part G – Chapter VII-1

Chapter VII – Inventive step

1.
General

An invention is considered to involve an inventive step if, having regard to 
the prior the art, it is not obvious to a person skilled in the art. Novelty and 
inventive step are different criteria. The question of whether there is 
inventive step only arises if the invention is novel.

2.
Prior art; date of filing, date of priority

The "prior art" for the purposes of considering inventive step is as defined 
in Art. 33(3). 

In determining what is to be considered prior art, the principles laid down in 
GL/PCT-EPO G-IV apply.

3.
Person skilled in the art

The "person skilled in the art" should be presumed to be a skilled 
practitioner in the relevant field of technology, who possesses average 
knowledge and ability and is aware of what was common general 
knowledge in the art at the relevant date. They should also be presumed to 
have had access to everything in the "prior art", in particular the documents 
cited in the search report, and to have had at their disposal the means and 
capacity for routine work and experimentation which are normal for the field 
of technology in question. If the problem prompts the person skilled in the 
art to seek its solution in another technical field, the specialist in that field is 
the person qualified to solve the problem. The skilled person is involved in 
constant development in their technical field.

3.1
Common general knowledge of the skilled person

Section G-VII, 3.1, in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

4.
Obviousness

Thus the question to consider, in relation to any claim defining the 
invention, is whether before the filing or priority date valid for that claim, 
having regard to the art known at the time, it would have been obvious to 
the person skilled in the art to arrive at something falling within the terms of 
the claim. If so, the claim is not allowable for lack of inventive step. The 
term "obvious" means that which does not go beyond the normal progress 
of technology but merely follows plainly or logically from the prior art, 
i.e. something which does not involve the exercise of any skill or ability 
beyond that to be expected of the person skilled in the art. In considering 
inventive step, as distinct from novelty, it is fair to construe any published 
document in the light of knowledge up to and including the day before the 
relevant date according to Rule 65.2 for the claimed invention and to have 
regard to all the knowledge generally available to the person skilled in the 
art up to and including that day.

5.
Problem-solution approach

In order to render the assessment of inventive step more objective, the 
EPO applies the so-called "problem-solution approach", which should be 
applied consistently.

Art. 33(3)
GL/ISPE 13.01

GL/ISPE 13.02

GL/ISPE 13.11

Rule 65.1
GL/ISPE 13.03, 
GL/ISPE 13.09, 
GL/ISPE 13.10

GL/ISPE 13.08,
GL/ISPE A13.08.1-
GL/ISPE A13.08.9


Part G – Chapter VII-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

In the problem-solution approach, there are three main stages:

(i)
determining the "closest prior art",

(ii)
establishing the "objective technical problem" to be solved, and

(iii)
considering whether or not the claimed invention, starting from the 
closest prior art and the objective technical problem, would have 
been obvious to the skilled person.

The EPO applies option A13.08.1 of the Appendix to Chapter 13 of the 
ISPE Guidelines.

5.1
Determination of the closest prior art

Generally, the principles laid down in section G-VII, 5.1, in the Guidelines 
for Examination in the EPO apply mutatis mutandis. The closest prior art is 
that which in one single reference discloses the combination of features 
which constitutes the most promising starting point for a development 
leading to the invention. In selecting the closest prior art, the first 
consideration is that it should be directed to a similar purpose or effect as 
the invention or at least belong to the same or a closely related technical 
field as the claimed invention. In practice, the closest prior art is generally 
that which corresponds to a similar use and requires the minimum of 
structural and functional modifications to arrive at the claimed invention.

5.2
Formulation of the objective technical problem

In the second stage, the examiner establishes in an objective way the 
technical problem to be solved. The method to do so is to study the 
application (or the patent), the closest prior art and the difference (also 
called "the distinguishing feature(s)" of the claimed invention) in terms of 
features (either structural or functional) between the claimed invention and 
the closest prior art, identify the technical effect resulting from the 
distinguishing features, and then formulate the technical problem.

The objective technical problem derived in this way may not be what the 
applicant presented as "the problem" in the application. The latter may 
require reformulation, since the objective technical problem is based on 
objectively established facts, in particular appearing in the prior art revealed 
in the course of the proceedings, which may be different from the prior art 
of which the applicant was actually aware at the time the application was 
filed. In particular, the prior art cited in the search report may put the 
invention in an entirely different perspective from that apparent from 
reading the application only. Reformulation might lead to the objective 
technical problem being less ambitious than originally envisaged by the 
application.

Section G-VII, 5.2, in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

5.3
Could-would approach

In the third stage the question to be answered is whether there is any 
teaching in the prior art as a whole that would (not simply could, but would) 

GL/ISPE 13.10, 
GL/ISPE A13.08.2

GL/ISPE A13.08.3-
GL/ISPE A13.08.7

GL/ISPE A13.08.8,
GL/ISPE A13.08.9


March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part G – Chapter VII-3

have prompted the skilled person, faced with the objective technical 
problem, to modify or adapt the closest prior art while taking account of that 
teaching, thereby arriving at something falling within the terms of the 
claims, and thus achieving what the invention achieves.

5.4
Claims comprising technical and non-technical features

Section G-VII, 5.4, in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

5.4.1
Formulation of the objective technical problem for claims 

comprising technical and non-technical features
Section G-VII, 5.4.1, in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

5.4.2
Examples of applying the steps listed in GL/EPO G-VII, 5.4

Illustrative examples can be found in section G-VII, 5.4.2, and subsections 
G-VII, 5.4.2.1 to G-VII, 5.4.2.5, in the Guidelines for Examination in the 
EPO.

6.
Combining pieces of prior art 

In the context of the problem-solution approach, it is permissible to combine 
the disclosure of one or more documents, parts of documents or other 
pieces of prior art (e.g. a public prior use or unwritten general technical 
knowledge) with the closest prior art. However, the fact that more than one 
disclosure must be combined with the closest prior art in order to arrive at a 
combination of features may be an indication of the presence of an 
inventive step, e.g. if the claimed invention is not a mere aggregation of 
features.

Section G-VII, 6, in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

7.
Combination vs. juxtaposition or aggregation

The invention claimed must normally be considered as a whole. When a 
claim consists of a "combination of features", it is not correct to argue that 
the separate features of the combination taken by themselves are known or 
obvious and that "therefore" the whole subject-matter claimed is obvious. 
However, where the claim is merely an "aggregation or juxtaposition of 
features" and not a true combination, it is enough to show that the 
individual features are obvious to prove that the aggregation of features 
does not involve an inventive step.

8.
Ex post facto analysis

It should be remembered that an invention which at first sight appears 
obvious might in fact involve an inventive step. Once a new idea has been 
formulated, it can often be shown theoretically how it might be arrived at, 
starting from something known, by a series of apparently easy steps. 
Examiners should be wary of ex post facto analysis of this kind. When 
combining documents cited in the search report, they should always bear in 
mind that the documents produced in the search have, of necessity, been 
obtained with foreknowledge of what matter constitutes the alleged 
invention. In all cases they should attempt to visualise the overall state of 

Rule 65.1

Part G – Chapter VII-4
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

the art confronting the skilled person before the applicant's contribution, 
and should seek to make a "real-life" assessment of this and other relevant 
factors. They should take into account all that is known concerning the 
background of the invention and give fair weight to relevant arguments or 
evidence submitted by the applicant, without the benefit of hindsight.

9.
Origin of an invention

While the claim should in each case be directed to technical features (and 
not, for example, merely to an idea), in order to assess whether an 
inventive step is present it is important for the examiner to bear in mind that 
an invention may, for example, be based on the following:

(i)
the devising of a solution to a known problem;

(ii)
the arrival at an insight into the cause of an observed phenomenon 
(the practical use of this phenomenon then being obvious).

Many inventions are of course based on a combination of the above 
possibilities - e.g. the arrival at an insight and the technical application of 
that insight may both involve the use of the inventive faculty.

10. Secondary indicators

10.1 Predictable disadvantage; non-functional modification; arbitrary 
choice
Section G-VII, 10.1, in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

10.2 Unexpected technical effect; bonus effect
Section G-VII, 10.2, in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

10.3 Long felt need; commercial success
See ISPE Guidelines 13.16-13.18.

11. Arguments and evidence submitted by the applicant
Section G-VII, 11, in the Guidelines for Examination in the EPO applies 
mutatis mutandis.

12. Selection inventions
Generally, the principles laid down in section G-VII, 12, in the Guidelines for 
Examination in the EPO apply mutatis mutandis. The subject-matter of 
selection inventions differs from the closest prior art in that it represents 
selected sub-sets or sub-ranges. If this selection is connected to a 
particular technical effect, and if no hints exist leading the skilled person to 
the selection, then an inventive step is accepted (this technical effect 
occurring within the selected range may also be the same effect as attained 
with the broader known range, but to an unexpected degree). The criterion 
of "seriously contemplating" mentioned in connection with the test for 
novelty of overlapping ranges should not be confused with the assessment 
of inventive step. For inventive step, it has to be considered whether the 
skilled person would have made the selection or would have chosen the 


March 2024
PCT-EPO Guidelines
Part G – Chapter VII-5

overlapping range in the hope of solving the underlying technical problem 
or in expectation of some improvement or advantage. If the answer is 
negative, then the claimed matter involves an inventive step.

The unexpected technical effect must apply to the entire range as claimed. 
If it occurs in only part of the claimed range, the claimed subject-matter 
does not solve the specific problem to which the effect relates, but only the 
more general problem of obtaining, for example, "a further product X" or "a 
further process Y".

Chapter I – The right to amend 

Chapter H-I deals with the right to amend, while Chapters H-II and H-III
deal with the allowability of amendments. Chapter H-IV is dedicated to the 
rectification of obvious mistakes.

1.
Introduction

Notwithstanding the possibility to amend the claims before the IB under 
Art. 19, an international application may be amended during the PCT 
Chapter II procedure. There are a number of important aspects to consider. 

Firstly, the amendments filed must be such that they can be taken into 
consideration by the EPO in its capacity as IPEA. The conditions governing 
timing and formal aspects are explained in GL/PCT-EPO H-I, 2
to 

GL/PCT-EPO H-I, 6.

Any change in the claims, the description or the drawings, other than a 
rectification of obvious mistakes under Rule 91, a correction under Rule 26
or the furnishing of missing parts under Rule 20.5 or correct elements or 
parts under Rule 20.5bis, is considered an amendment. Unless withdrawn 
or superseded by later amendments, any change considered an 
amendment must be taken into consideration for the purpose of the 
international preliminary examination. 

Secondly, amendments must be allowable, which means that they must 
not:

(i)
add to the application subject-matter which was not disclosed in the 
application as originally filed

(ii)
introduce other deficiencies (such as lack of clarity in the claims).

2.
Amendments before receipt of the search report 

There is no right to amend the application until after the international search 
report has been established. Obvious mistakes, on the other hand, may be 
corrected (see GL/PCT-EPO H-IV).

3.
Amendments prior to the start of international preliminary 

examination 
When filing the demand, the applicant should indicate on Form 
PCT/IPEA/401 which documents should form the basis for international 
preliminary examination. These may be:

–
the international application as originally filed, or

–
amendments to the claims under Art. 19 and/or

–
amendments to the claims, the description and/or sequence listings 
filed as a part thereof and/or the drawings under Art. 34(2)(b).

Part H – Chapter I-2
PCT-EPO Guidelines
March 2024

The applicant may have filed amended claims under Art. 19 with the 
International Bureau after receipt of the search report and before the 
demand was filed. When filing the demand, the applicant may revert to the 
originally filed claims, reversing the amendments made according to 
Art. 19. If this is the case, preliminary examination proceeds on the basis of 
the originally filed set of claims. 

Amendments and/or arguments filed under Art. 34 should preferably be 
filed together with the demand. Where the applicant indicates in the 
statement concerning amendments filed with the demand that it is doing so, 
but fails to actually submit the amendments with the demand, the EPO as 
IPEA will invite the applicant to submit them within a set time limit 
(Form PCT/IPEA/431). Where the applicant has expressly requested 
postponement of the start of international preliminary examination until 
expiry of the time limit under Rule 54bis.1(a), the EPO as IPEA will take 
into account any amendments and/or arguments under Art. 34 which are 
filed before then (see also GL/PCT-EPO C-VI, 1).

The examiner should carefully check that the examination is based on the 
correct set of documents. 

4.
Further opportunity to submit amendments

Together with the reply to the WO-ISA, the WO-IPEA or the minutes of a 
telephone consultation, the applicant has, subject to certain exceptions 
(see GL/PCT-EPO, C-VII, 1(d)), the opportunity to submit (further) 
amendments under Art. 34 to the claims, description and/or drawings. 

Subsequently filed amendments and/or arguments will be taken into 
account by the EPO as IPEA only if they are received before the point at 
which preparation of a written opinion or the IPER has actually started. 

For further details, see GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 1 and GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 2 and 
subsections, and GL/PCT-EPO C-VII, 1.

5.
Amended sheets

Amendments to the claims, the description and the drawings must be made 
by filing replacement sheets when, on account of the amendments, the 
replacement sheet differs from the sheets previously filed. 

If amendments are made to the claims, a complete set of new claims 
should be filed.

The applicant may submit amendments by fax and there is no need for a 
confirmation letter, unless the faxed document is illegible. Printed or typed 
amendments are preferred; handwritten amendments are, in general, not 
acceptable. Nevertheless, if the handwritten amendments are legible they 
may – at the discretion of the EPO – be admitted.

If amendments are made to a sequence listing contained in an application 
filed in electronic form, a sequence listing in electronic form comprising the 
entire listing with the relevant amendment must be filed.

Indication of amendments and their basis 

The applicant is obliged to indicate the basis in the application as originally 
filed for any amendments filed. If no such basis is indicated, the IPER may 
be established as if the amendments had not been made. This is indicated 
in the IPER under Section I.

If a further WO-IPEA (Form 408) is sent (with respect for the principles set 
out in GL/PCT-EPO C-IV, 2.2), there should be a similar indication in the 
WO-IPEA as to which amendments could not be taken into account.
Further, the applicant may also be reminded in this WO-IPEA to specify the 
basis for the amendments which may be filed in reply to the WO-IPEA. 
However, a WO-IPEA whose only content would be a request to indicate 
the basis for such amendments will not be sent; instead, the IPER is 
established directly.

Chapter II – Allowability of amendments 

1.
Introduction

Once the EPO as IPEA has concluded that the amendments can be taken 
into consideration (see GL/PCT-EPO H-I), all amended pages (description, 
claims, drawings) must be examined to see whether they introduce 
subject-matter not originally disclosed. The examiner should apply the 
criteria used under Art. 123(2) EPC for the European procedure mutatis 
mutandis, as indicated below. It is important to note that an amendment 
which is taken into consideration by the EPO as IPEA is not automatically 
allowable.

With regard to establishing the WO-IPEA or IPER if any newly filed claim, 
drawing or part of the description contains amendments which are 
considered to go beyond the disclosure as
originally filed, see 

GL/PCT-EPO C-III, 4.

2.
Allowability of amendments 

2.1
Basic principle

The examiner should apply the guidelines of section H-IV, 2.1, in the 
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO mutatis mutandis. 

2.2
Content of the application as "originally" filed – general rules

The examiner should apply the guidelines of section H-IV, 2.2, in the 
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO mutatis mutandis. 

2.2.1
Features described in a document cross-referenced in the 

description
The examiner should apply the guidelines of section H-IV, 2.2.1, in the 
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO mutatis mutandis. 

2.2.2
Incorporating missing or correct parts or elements completely 

contained in the priority document
If the applicant files (a) missing or correct part(s) (i.e. part(s) of the 
description, part(s) of the claims and/or part(s) or all of the drawings) and/or 
(a) missing or correct element(s) (i.e. all of the description and/or all of the 
claims), the filing date of the application as a whole will be the date on 
which the part(s) and/or the element(s) was (were) subsequently furnished, 
unless the RO accepted the incorporation by reference of the missing or 
correct part(s) and/or element(s).

An applicant therefore has the possibility to furnish parts of the application 
and/or entire elements which were erroneously omitted without affecting the 
international filing date by requesting their incorporation by reference to the 
priority document (see GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 5).

Similarly, an applicant therefore also has the possibility to request the 
correction of erroneously filed parts of the application and/or entire 
elements without affecting the international filing date by requesting their 
incorporation by reference to the priority document. This latter possibility is, 
however, not available before all ROs. In particular, the EPO acting as RO

framework 
under 
the 
EPC; 
see 

GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 6. However, following the withdrawal of this notification 
of incompatibility with effect from 1 November 2022, the EPO as RO may 
now also process requests for incorporation by reference of the correct 
element or part for international applications filed on or after 1 November 
2022. See GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 6.2.

The activity of the EPO as ISA and IPEA depends on the decisions taken 
by the RO with regard to the international application and its filing date (see 
GL/PCT-EPO B-III, 2.3.3
and 
GL/PCT-EPO B-III, 2.3.4, 
and 

GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 2.1).

A request for incorporation by reference can only be filed before the RO 
within two months of the date of receipt of the purported international 
application (or at the invitation of the RO) provided that the priority claim 
was present at that initial date of receipt and only if the applicant can show 
that the missing or correct part(s) and/or element(s) was (were) completely 
contained in the priority document. Missing or correct parts and/or elements 
which have been accepted under this criterion are considered to be part of 
the application documents "as originally filed" (see GL/PCT-EPO B-III, 2.3.4
and GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 2.1). 

If the RO finds that the "completely contained" criterion is not met, the filing 
date of the application will be the date on which the part(s) and/or the 
element(s) was (were) subsequently furnished (unless, in the case of 
missing parts or of correct elements and/or parts, the applicant withdraws 
the subsequently furnished elements and/or parts). Where the EPO is 
(S)ISA or IPEA, the examiner must check (as far as the documents needed 
are available) whether the RO's assessment of the "completely contained" 
criterion was correct.

See also GL/PCT-EPO A-II, 5.

2.2.2.1
Test for "completely contained"

The test for "completely contained" is stricter than the test for added 
subject-matter since it is a test whether the subsequently filed missing or 
correct part(s) and/or element(s) was (were) identical to the corresponding 
extract in the priority document, or a translation thereof.

Although the RO is responsible for the decision on whether the missing or 
correct part(s) and/or element(s) was (were) completely contained in the 
priority document, the examiner must check (as far as the documents 
needed are available) that the decision taken was correct. 

If the EPO is the RO, the examiner is only required to check for additional 
technical content. This entails ensuring that the missing text has been 
inserted into the application in such a position that it has exactly the same 
meaning as it had in the priority document.

If the EPO is not the RO, the identity of drawings and the word-for-word 
identity of (parts of) the description/claim(s) must also be checked by the 
examiner (unless the documents needed are not available at this stage).

2.2.2.2
Review by the examiner

If the missing or correct part(s) and/or element(s) was (were) indeed 
completely contained in the priority document, the examiner will treat the 
file as having the filing date accorded by the RO. The examiner will proceed 
in the same way where unable to check whether the missing or correct
part(s) and/or element(s) was (were) indeed completely contained in the 
priority document because, at the time of the search or the preliminary 
examination, the priority document(s) or any other document needed 
(i.e. the subsequently filed sheet(s) embodying the missing or correct
part(s)/element(s) or the translation of the priority document) is (are) not 
available to the ISA or IPEA. If the documents needed for the check are not 
available, this will be indicated in the WO-ISA/IPER, in Section I of the 
separate sheet. 

If the missing or correct part(s) and/or element(s) was (were) not 
completely contained in the priority document, the decision on the filing 
date made by the RO is still valid for the international phase. However, the 
examiner will indicate in the WO-ISA/IPER in Section I of the separate 
sheet that there are doubts as to whether the missing or correct part(s) 
and/or element(s) was (were) actually completely contained in the priority 
document. The search report and the WO-ISA or the IPER, as applicable, 
will also include documents which would be relevant if the application were 
to be redated (see GL/PCT-EPO B-III, 2.3.3).

A review of the decision by the RO can only take place in the regional 
phase (Rule 82ter.1(b)).

After entry into the regional phase before the EPO (Euro-PCT phase) the 
applicant can withdraw the subsequently filed missing or correct parts 
and/or correct elements in order to avoid the redating of the application. In 
this case, it should be noted that amendments which are acceptable under 
the less strict criterion of Art. 123(2) EPC can always be filed during the 
Euro-PCT phase.

2.2.3
Sequence listings filed after the date of filing

Any sequence listing not contained in the international application as filed 
will – if not allowable as an amendment under Article 34 – not form part of 
the international application. 

See GL/PCT-EPO B-VIII, 3.2, for the effect on the search and 
GL/PCT-EPO B-XI, 7, for the effect on the WO-ISA. For the effect on 
examination in Chapter II, see GL/PCT-EPO C-VIII, 2.1.

2.2.4
Priority documents

It is not permissible to add to an international application matter present 
only in the priority document for that application, unless this is done under 
the provisions of Rule 20.6 (GL/PCT-EPO H-II, 2.2.2). For correction of 
errors, see GL/PCT-EPO H-IV.

Introduction

This Chapter provides additional guidance and examples relating to a 
number of typical situations where compliance with Art. 19(2) and/or 
Art. 34(2)(b) is an issue. However, it must be borne in mind that the 
allowability of a specific amendment is ultimately to be decided on a 
case-by-case basis.

2.

Disclaimers not disclosed in the application as originally filed

4.1
The subject-matter to be excluded is not disclosed in the 

application as originally filed (so-called undisclosed disclaimers)
The examiner should apply the guidelines of section H-V, 4.2.1, in the 
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO mutatis mutandis. 

The EPO applies option A20.21[2] of the Appendix to Chapter 20 of the 
ISPE Guidelines.

4.2
The subject-matter to be excluded is disclosed in the application 

as originally filed
The examiner should apply the guidelines of section H-V, 4.2.2, in the 
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO mutatis mutandis. 

5.
Amendments to drawings

It is normally not possible under Art. 34(2)(b) to add completely new 
drawings to an application, since in most cases a new drawing cannot be 
unambiguously derivable from the mere text of the description. For the 
same reasons amendments to drawings should be carefully checked for 
compliance with Art. 34(2)(b).

For drawings based on the priority document, see GL/PCT-EPO H-II, 2.2.2
and subsections.

6.
Amendments derived from drawings

The examiner should apply the guidelines of section H-V, 6, in the 
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO mutatis mutandis. 

7.
Amendments to the title

The sole purpose of the title is to inform the public about the technical 
information disclosed in the application. The examiner does not need the 
applicant's approval to compose or amend the title.

Under Rule 5.1, the title is considered to be a part of the description. Under 
Rule 37.2, in the absence of a title, or when the title does not comply with 
Rule 4.3 (i.e. it is too long or not precise enough), the search examiner can 
compose a title or amend the existing one. On the basis of these two rules 
taken in conjunction, the EPO as ISA may accept amendments of the title 
proposed by the applicant, provided that any such amendments do not go 
beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed.

Chapter IV – Correction of defects and errors

1.
Substitute sheets (Rule 26)

If the RO finds defects under Art. 14(1)(a), it invites the applicant to correct 
them by submitting replacement sheets which will be stamped 
"SUBSTITUTE SHEET (RULE 26)", and these will retain the original filing 
date if submitted within the set time limit.

2.
Request for rectification of obvious mistakes in the application 

documents (Rule 91) 

2.1
Introduction

An applicant can request authorisation to rectify obvious mistakes in the 
international application. Rectification is authorised on condition that:

(i)
the mistake is obvious to the skilled person, i.e. that something else 
was intended than what appears in the document concerned, and

(ii)
the rectification is obvious to the skilled person, i.e. that nothing else 
could have been intended than the proposed correction. 

The applicant may submit a request for rectification of an obvious mistake 
in the description, claims and drawings (not the abstract) of the 
international application (including amended documents) to the ISA or the 
IPEA, which is the competent body to authorise or refuse such rectification. 
If the obvious mistake is related to the request form (PCT/RO/101), it is the 
RO which authorises or refuses the rectification. 

2.2
Authorisation or refusal of the request for rectification of 

obvious mistakes in the application documents
In order to determine whether the request for rectification of obvious 
mistakes can be authorised, the examiner should check that the time limit 
for requesting rectification has not expired. The request for rectification can 
only be considered if it is filed with the competent authority within 
26 months from the priority date. 

If the request is too late, it is refused on that ground.

If the request is in time, the examiner must check whether the requested 
rectifications 
satisfy 
the 
above 
criteria 
(i) 
and 
(ii)
(see 

GL/PCT-EPO H-IV, 2.1).

–
If one or both of the criteria (i) and (ii) are not satisfied, the examiner 
will not authorise the request and will indicate the reasons. 

–
If the request is authorised, no reasons need to be given. The fact 
that a rectification of an obvious mistake has been taken into account 
will be indicated in the WO-ISA, WO-IPEA (Form 408) or IPER 
(Form 409) under Section I.

–
If the request is authorised only in part, the examiner indicates which 
rectifications are not allowable, together with the reasons, and which

Part H – Chapter IV-2

rectifications are allowable. The fact that a rectification of an obvious 
mistake has been taken into account (in part) will also be indicated in 
the WO-ISA, WO-IPEA (Form 408) or IPER (Form 409) under 
Section I.

Authorised replacement pages or sheets for rectification of obvious 
mistakes under Rule 91 are deemed to be part of the international 
application "as originally filed". These sheets are identified with 
"RECTIFIED SHEET (RULE 91.1)".

If authorisation of a request for rectification is refused, the applicant may 
request the IB in writing, within two months of the refusal, to publish the 
refused request together with the reasons for refusal, subject to payment of 
a special fee. 

2.3
Allowability of rectifications

The examiner will apply the same criteria in assessing the substantive 
allowability of proposed rectifications according to Rule 91.1
as for 

European applications according to Rule 139 EPC
(see GL/EPO 

H-VI, 2.2.1).

2.4
Examples

The examiner should apply the guidelines of section H-VI, 2.2.1, in the 
Guidelines for Examination in the EPO mutatis mutandis.
